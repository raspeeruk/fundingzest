  {
    question: "What is an installment loan?",
    answer:
      "An installment loan is a loan that you repay in fixed, scheduled payments (installments) over a set period, typically 3 to 60 months. Unlike payday loans that require full repayment at once, installment loans spread the cost over time, making monthly payments more manageable.",
  },
  {
    question: "How are installment loans different from payday loans?",
    answer:
      "Payday loans are repaid in a single lump sum (usually within 2-4 weeks) and are limited to small amounts ($100-$1,000). Installment loans are repaid in multiple monthly payments over months or years, offer larger amounts ($500-$35,000), and generally have lower APRs. Installment loans are available in all 50 states, while payday loans are restricted in many states.",
  },
  {
    question: "What credit score do I need for an installment loan?",
    answer:
      "Credit requirements vary by lender. Traditional banks typically require scores of 670+. Online lenders may accept scores as low as 580, and some specialize in bad credit lending with no minimum score requirement. Higher scores generally qualify for lower APRs.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I pay off an installment loan early?",
    answer:
      "Most online installment lenders allow early repayment without penalties. However, some lenders charge prepayment penalties. Always check the loan terms for prepayment clauses before accepting. Paying early saves you money on interest.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I borrow with an installment loan?",
    answer:
      "Online installment loans typically range from $500 to $35,000, depending on the lender, your creditworthiness, income, and state regulations. Some lenders offer up to $50,000 or more for well-qualified borrowers.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do installment loans affect my credit score?",
    answer:
      "Yes, most installment lenders report to one or more credit bureaus. Making on-time payments can improve your credit score over time. Late or missed payments will hurt your score. The initial hard credit inquiry may temporarily lower your score by a few points.",
  },

                What Are Installment Loans?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                An installment loan is a type of loan where you borrow a fixed
                amount and repay it in equal monthly payments over a set period.
                Each payment includes a portion of the principal (the amount
                borrowed) plus interest. Your payment amount stays the same
                every month, making it easy to budget.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                Installment loans are one of the most common forms of consumer
                lending. Auto loans, mortgages, and student loans are all types
                of installment loans. Personal installment loans offer the
                flexibility to use funds for any purpose.
