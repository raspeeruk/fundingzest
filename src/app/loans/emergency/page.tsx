  {
    question: "What qualifies as an emergency loan?",
    answer:
      "An emergency loan is any personal loan used to cover an unexpected, urgent expense — medical bills, car repairs, emergency travel, urgent home repairs, or other costs that can't wait until your next paycheck. There is no formal definition; it's about the borrower's need for fast funding.",
  },
  {
    question: "How fast can I get an emergency loan?",
    answer:
      "Many online lenders offer approval decisions within minutes and can deposit funds as soon as the same business day or next business day. For same-day funding, apply early on a weekday (before 10:30 AM ET) with all required documents ready.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need good credit for an emergency loan?",
    answer:
      "No. Many emergency loan lenders accept applicants with bad credit or no credit history. They evaluate your income and ability to repay rather than relying solely on credit scores. Expect higher APRs with lower credit scores.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I borrow for an emergency?",
    answer:
      "Emergency loan amounts typically range from $100 to $5,000 depending on the lender, your income, and your state. Borrow only what you need to cover the emergency — taking out more means paying more in interest.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I need money before my next paycheck?",
    answer:
      "Short-term options include payday loans (repaid on your next payday), earned wage access apps (like Earnin or Dave that let you access wages you've already earned), credit card cash advances, or asking your employer for a paycheck advance.",
  },
  {
    question: "Should I use a credit card or an emergency loan?",
    answer:
      "If you have available credit, a credit card is usually cheaper — typical credit card APRs are 20-30% compared to 200%+ for payday loans. However, credit card cash advances carry higher rates and fees than purchases. If you don't have available credit, an emergency loan may be your best option.",
