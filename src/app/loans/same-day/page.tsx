    question: "Can I really get a loan the same day I apply?",
    answer:
      "Yes, many online lenders offer same-day funding for applications completed and approved early in the business day, typically before 10:30 AM ET. However, funding speed depends on your bank's processing times, the lender's policies, and whether the application is complete and verified quickly.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do I need to apply for a same day loan?",
    answer:
      "You typically need: a valid government-issued ID, proof of income (pay stubs, bank statements, or tax returns), an active checking account with direct deposit, a valid email address, and a phone number. Having these ready speeds up the process.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are same day loans more expensive than regular loans?",
    answer:
      "Not necessarily. Same day loans are not a separate loan product — they are regular payday or installment loans from lenders that process applications quickly. The cost depends on the loan type, amount, and your credit profile, not the funding speed.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if I apply after business hours?",
    answer:
      "Applications submitted after business hours, on weekends, or on holidays are typically processed the next business day. To maximize your chance of same-day funding, apply as early as possible on a weekday.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a same day loan with bad credit?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many lenders that offer fast funding also accept applicants with bad credit. The approval decision is based on your income and ability to repay, not just your credit score. Expect higher APRs with lower credit scores.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much can I borrow with a same day loan?",
    answer:
      "Same day loan amounts typically range from $100 to $5,000 depending on the lender and your state. Smaller amounts ($100-$1,000) are more commonly funded the same day, while larger amounts may require additional verification.",

                What Are Same Day Loans?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                Same day loans are any loan products where the lender can approve
                your application and deposit funds into your bank account within
                the same business day. This includes payday loans, personal
                installment loans, and lines of credit from lenders with
                streamlined application processes.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                The key factor is the lender&apos;s processing speed, not the
                loan type itself. Many online lenders have automated
                underwriting systems that can evaluate your application in
                minutes rather than days.
