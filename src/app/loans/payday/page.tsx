    question: "What is a payday loan?",
    answer:
      "A payday loan is a short-term, small-dollar loan typically due on your next payday. Loan amounts usually range from $100 to $1,000 with repayment terms of 2 to 4 weeks. They are designed for borrowers who need quick access to cash for unexpected expenses.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does a payday loan cost?",
    answer:
      "Payday loan costs vary by state and lender. Fees typically range from $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed, which translates to APRs of 260% to 780%. For example, borrowing $500 with a $15 per $100 fee costs $75 in fees, for a total repayment of $575. Always review the full cost before accepting any loan offer.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are payday loans legal in every state?",
    answer:
      "No. As of 2026, payday lending is legal and regulated in approximately 32 states. States including New York, New Jersey, Georgia, and others prohibit payday lending or cap rates low enough to effectively ban them. Check your state's regulations before applying.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I get a payday loan with bad credit?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many payday lenders do not rely heavily on traditional credit scores. Instead, they focus on your income, employment status, and ability to repay the loan. However, borrowers with lower credit scores may receive higher APRs.",
  },
  {
    question: "How quickly can I get funds from a payday loan?",
    answer:
      "Many online payday lenders offer approval decisions within minutes. If approved, funds are typically deposited into your bank account as soon as the next business day. Some lenders offer same-day funding for applications submitted early in the day.",
  },
  {
    question: "What are the alternatives to payday loans?",
    answer:
      "Alternatives include credit union payday alternative loans (PALs) with APRs capped at 28%, earned wage access apps like Earnin or Dave, credit card cash advances, payment plans with your creditor, local emergency assistance programs, and borrowing from family or friends.",
  },
  {
    question: "What happens if I can't repay a payday loan on time?",
    answer:
      "Contact your lender immediately. Depending on your state, options may include an extended payment plan, a loan extension (rollover), or a cooling-off period before taking a new loan. Failure to repay can result in additional fees, collection activity, and damage to your credit. Some states prohibit rollovers to prevent debt cycles.",
  },
  {
    question: "Does applying for a payday loan affect my credit score?",
    answer:
      "Submitting your information through FundingZest does not affect your credit score. Most payday lenders perform a soft credit check or no credit check during the application. However, if you fail to repay, the debt may be sent to collections, which can negatively impact your credit.",

                A payday loan is a short-term, small-dollar loan designed to
                cover expenses until your next paycheck. Borrowers typically
                repay the full loan amount plus fees in a single payment on their
                next payday, usually within 2 to 4 weeks.

                Payday loans are available from both storefront locations and
                online lenders. Online payday loans have become increasingly
                popular because they allow borrowers to complete the entire
                process from home and receive funds via direct deposit.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                These loans are intended for short-term financial needs such as
                emergency car repairs, medical bills, utility payments, or other
                unexpected expenses. They are not designed for long-term
                borrowing or large purchases.
