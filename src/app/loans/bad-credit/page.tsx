    question: "What credit score is considered bad credit?",
    answer:
      "FICO scores below 580 are generally considered 'poor' credit, while scores between 580 and 669 are 'fair.' Many lenders in FundingZest's network consider applicants with scores below 580 or even those with no credit history at all. Your credit score is just one factor lenders evaluate.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can I really get a loan with bad credit?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Many lenders specialize in lending to borrowers with bad credit. They evaluate factors beyond your credit score, including your current income, employment stability, existing debts, and banking history. You may receive higher APRs, but approval is possible.",
  },
  {
    question: "Will applying for a bad credit loan hurt my credit score?",
    answer:
      "Submitting your information through FundingZest does not affect your credit score. Some lenders perform a soft credit check during pre-qualification, which has no impact. If you proceed with a lender and they perform a hard credit check, that may temporarily lower your score by a few points.",
  },
  {
    question: "What interest rates can I expect with bad credit?",
    answer:
      "APRs for bad credit loans typically range from 36% to 400%+ depending on the loan type, amount, and your specific financial situation. Smaller, shorter-term loans tend to have higher APRs. Installment loans for bad credit generally have lower APRs than payday loans.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can I improve my chances of approval?",
    answer:
      "To improve your chances: apply with accurate information, demonstrate steady income, reduce existing debts where possible, have an active bank account with regular deposits, consider a co-signer if available, and only borrow what you can afford to repay.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can a bad credit loan help improve my credit score?",
    answer:
      "Yes, if the lender reports to credit bureaus (not all do). Making on-time payments on an installment loan can gradually improve your credit score. Ask the lender whether they report to Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion before accepting.",

                What Are Bad Credit Loans?
              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4 text-gray-600">
                Bad credit loans are lending products designed for borrowers
                whose credit scores fall below what traditional banks require.
                While conventional lenders often require scores of 670+, bad
                credit lenders consider applicants with FICO scores below 580,
                limited credit history, or past financial difficulties such as
                bankruptcy or collections.
              </p>
              <p className="text-gray-600">
                These lenders evaluate your full financial picture — including
                your income, employment, and banking history — rather than
                relying solely on your credit score. The trade-off is typically
                higher interest rates and fees compared to loans available to
                borrowers with good credit.
