        <p>
          FundingZest is a loan comparison service that connects consumers with lenders. We are not a lender, do not make credit decisions, and do not guarantee that you will receive a loan offer. The lenders in our network independently determine whether to offer you a loan, and what rates and terms to provide.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Eligibility</h2>
        <p>
          You must be at least 18 years old and a US resident to use our service. By submitting information through our platform, you represent that all information you provide is accurate and complete.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">No Guarantee of Loan Offers</h2>
        <p>
          Submitting your information through FundingZest does not guarantee that you will receive a loan offer. Approval decisions are made solely by the lenders in our network based on their own criteria.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Third-Party Lenders</h2>
        <p>
          When you are connected with a lender through our platform, your relationship with that lender is governed by their own terms, conditions, and privacy policy. FundingZest is not responsible for the actions, products, or services of any third-party lender.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Limitation of Liability</h2>

          FundingZest provides information for general educational purposes. We are not financial advisors and do not provide financial advice. You should consult with a qualified financial professional before making any borrowing decisions. Our service is provided &ldquo;as is&rdquo; without warranties of any kind.
