        <p>
          FundingZest is a loan comparison service that connects borrowers with
          lenders. We are not a lender, do not make credit decisions, and do not
          broker loans. Our goal is to help consumers compare their options and
          find the right loan for their needs.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">Our Mission</h2>
        <p>
          We believe that everyone deserves access to transparent, easy-to-understand
          information about borrowing options. Our platform makes it simple to
          compare rates, terms, and fees from multiple lenders so you can make
          an informed decision.
        </p>

        <h2 className="text-xl font-bold text-gray-900">How We Make Money</h2>
        <p>
          FundingZest earns referral fees when consumers are matched with
          lenders through our platform. This compensation helps us keep our
          service free for consumers. It may influence how and where lenders
          appear on our site, but it does not affect our editorial content or
          the information we provide about each loan option.
        </p>
