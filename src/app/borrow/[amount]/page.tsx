      question: `Can I get a ${loan.displayAmount} loan with bad credit?`,
      answer: `Yes, many lenders in FundingZest's network consider applicants with bad credit or no credit history for ${loan.displayAmount} loans. Approval depends on factors beyond credit score, including income and employment status. APRs may be higher for borrowers with lower credit scores.`,
    },
    {
      question: `How fast can I get a ${loan.displayAmount} loan?`,
      answer: `Many lenders can provide approval decisions within minutes. If approved, funds are typically deposited into your bank account as soon as the next business day. Some lenders offer same-day funding for applications completed early in the day.`,
    },
    {
      question: `What are the requirements for a ${loan.displayAmount} loan?`,
      answer: `Requirements vary by lender but typically include: being at least 18 years old, having a regular source of income, having an active bank account, and being a US citizen or permanent resident. Some lenders may have minimum income requirements.`,
    },
    {
      question: `How much does a ${loan.displayAmount} loan cost?`,
      answer: `The total cost depends on the APR and repayment term. For example, a ${loan.displayAmount} loan at ${midApr}% APR over ${midTerm} months would cost approximately $${midExample.totalCost.toLocaleString()} in total ($${midExample.monthlyPayment.toLocaleString()}/month). Always review the full terms before accepting any loan offer.`,
    },
    {
      question: `What can I use a ${loan.displayAmount} loan for?`,
      answer: `You can use a ${loan.displayAmount} loan for almost any purpose, including emergency expenses, medical bills, car repairs, utility payments, debt consolidation, or other unexpected costs. The lender typically does not restrict how you use the funds.`,
    },
    {
      question: `Is it safe to apply for a ${loan.displayAmount} loan online?`,
      answer: `Yes, applying through FundingZest is safe. We use 256-bit SSL encryption to protect your information. We only connect you with licensed lenders who comply with federal and state regulations. Your information is never sold to third parties without your consent.`,
