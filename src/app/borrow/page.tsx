          How to Choose the Right Loan Amount

          <p>
            Borrowing the right amount is important. Taking out more than you
            need means paying more in interest, while borrowing too little may
            leave you short. Here are some guidelines:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-2">
            <li>
              <strong>Only borrow what you need</strong> &mdash; Calculate the
              exact amount required for your expense before applying.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Consider your repayment ability</strong> &mdash; Make sure
              the monthly payments fit comfortably within your budget.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Compare total costs</strong> &mdash; A lower monthly
              payment with a longer term may cost more overall due to interest.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Check state regulations</strong> &mdash; Some states cap
              the maximum loan amount for certain loan types.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </div>
