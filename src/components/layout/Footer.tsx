              FundingZest is a loan comparison service, not a lender. We connect
              borrowers with lenders in our network and may receive compensation
              when you are matched with a lender. The operator of this website is
              not a lender, does not make credit decisions, and does not broker
              loans. Your lender will provide you with specific terms and rates
              upon approval.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              APR ranges and loan terms vary by lender and your individual
              financial situation. Representative example: A $500 loan with a
              12-month term at 199% APR would have monthly payments of
              approximately $72 and a total cost of $864. Actual rates may be
              higher or lower.
            </p>
            <p className="mt-2">
              Not all applicants will qualify. Approval and loan terms are at the
              sole discretion of the lender. Submitting a request does not
              guarantee you will receive a loan offer.
