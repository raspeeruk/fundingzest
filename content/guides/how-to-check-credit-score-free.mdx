faqs:
  - question: "Is it really free to check my credit score?"
    answer: "Yes. Federal law guarantees free weekly access to your credit reports from all three bureaus through AnnualCreditReport.com. Additionally, many banks, credit cards, and free services like Credit Karma provide free credit score access with no impact on your score."
  - question: "Does checking my own credit score hurt it?"
    answer: "No. Checking your own credit score or report is a 'soft inquiry' and has zero impact on your score. You can check as often as you like. Only 'hard inquiries' from lenders (when you apply for credit) can temporarily affect your score."
  - question: "What's the difference between a credit score and a credit report?"
    answer: "A credit report is a detailed record of your credit history — accounts, balances, payment history, and public records. A credit score is a three-digit number (300-850) calculated from the data in your credit report. Think of the report as your full transcript and the score as your GPA."
  - question: "Why are my credit scores different on different sites?"
    answer: "You have multiple credit scores because there are different scoring models (FICO, VantageScore), different versions of each model, and three different credit bureaus with slightly different data. A 20-40 point difference between scores is normal and not a cause for concern."
  - question: "What should I look for on my credit report?"
    answer: "Check for: accounts you don't recognize (possible identity theft), incorrect late payments, wrong balances or credit limits, duplicate accounts, incorrect personal information, and accounts in collections you've already paid. Errors are more common than you think — the FTC found 1 in 4 reports contain errors."

Your credit score is one of the most important numbers in your financial life. It determines whether you get approved for loans, what interest rates you pay, and can even affect your ability to rent an apartment or get hired for certain jobs. The good news is that checking your credit score and credit report is completely free — and you should be doing it regularly.

In this guide, we walk through every legitimate way to check your credit score for free, how to read your credit report, and what to do if you find errors.

## Why Checking Your Credit Matters

Your credit score follows you through nearly every major financial decision. Lenders use it to decide whether to approve your [loan application](/apply) and what interest rate to charge you. Landlords check it before approving a rental application. Insurance companies use it to set premiums in many states. Some employers review credit reports during the hiring process.

Despite how important credit is, a surprising number of people never check theirs — or only check it when they are about to apply for credit. That is a mistake for several reasons.

**Errors are alarmingly common.** A landmark Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study found that [1 in 4 consumers identified errors on their credit reports](https://consumer.ftc.gov/credit-loans-and-debt) that could affect their scores. These errors range from incorrect account information to accounts that do not belong to you at all. If you are not checking your report, you have no way of knowing whether errors are dragging your score down.

**Fraud and identity theft are on the rise.** If someone opens an account in your name, it will show up on your credit report. Catching it early limits the damage. Regular monitoring is your first line of defense.

**Your score changes over time.** Your credit score is not static. It fluctuates based on your financial behavior — paying bills, opening or closing accounts, changes in balances. Tracking these changes helps you understand what helps and what hurts your score. If you are working to [improve your credit score](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score), regular monitoring lets you see your progress.

<Callout type="tip" title="Checking Your Own Credit Never Hurts Your Score">
Checking your own credit score or report is a **soft inquiry** with zero impact on your score. You can check as often as you like. Only hard inquiries from lenders (when you apply for credit) can temporarily affect your score.

The bottom line: checking your credit is free, takes only a few minutes, and has zero negative impact on your score. There is no reason not to do it.

## Free Ways to Check Your Credit Score

You have several legitimate, no-cost options for checking your credit score. Here are the best ones available in 2026.

### 1. Your Bank or Credit Card Issuer

Most major banks and credit card issuers now provide free FICO score access to their customers. Chase, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citi, Capital One, American Express, and many others offer this feature through their online banking portals or mobile apps. This is often the most convenient option because you are already logging in to manage your accounts.

### 2. Credit Karma

Credit Karma provides free VantageScore 3.0 credit scores from both TransUnion and Equifax. It updates weekly and includes credit monitoring, alerts for changes to your report, and personalized recommendations. Credit Karma makes money through advertising and product recommendations, not by charging you.

### 3. Experian Free Account

Experian offers a free account that gives you access to your FICO Score 8 based on your Experian credit report. This is notable because FICO Score 8 is the most widely used scoring model by lenders. You also get access to your Experian credit report and free monitoring alerts.

### 4. Credit Sesame

Credit Sesame provides a free VantageScore 3.0 from TransUnion. Like Credit Karma, it includes credit monitoring and financial recommendations. The free tier covers the basics, though Credit Sesame also offers paid premium plans with additional features.

### 5. Discover Credit Scorecard

Discover offers its Credit Scorecard tool to anyone — you do not need to be a Discover customer. It provides your FICO Score 8 from Experian and updates monthly. There is no credit card required and no enrollment fees.

### Free Credit Score Services Comparison

| Service | Score Type | Bureau(s) | Update Frequency | Extras |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Your Bank/Card Issuer | Usually FICO | Varies | Monthly | Integrated with banking |
| Credit Karma | VantageScore 3.0 | TransUnion + Equifax | Weekly | Credit monitoring, alerts, tax filing |
| Experian Free Account | FICO Score 8 | Experian | Monthly | Experian report access, monitoring |
| Credit Sesame | VantageScore 3.0 | TransUnion | Monthly | Credit monitoring, identity theft tools |
| Discover Credit Scorecard | FICO Score 8 | Experian | Monthly | No account required |

<Callout type="warning" title="Avoid Fake Free Score Sites">
Avoid any site that asks for your credit card number to show you a "free" credit score. Legitimate free services do **not** require payment information. If a site is asking for payment details, it is likely a free trial that converts to a paid subscription.

## How to Get Your Free Credit Reports

Your credit score is a summary, but your credit report contains the full picture. Getting your actual credit report is essential — it is where you will find the details that drive your score and spot any errors.

### AnnualCreditReport.com: The Only Official Source

[AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/) is the only website authorized by federal law to provide your free credit reports from all three major bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. This site was created as a result of the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA) and is operated jointly by the three bureaus.

Originally, consumers were entitled to one free report per bureau per year. However, since 2020, all three bureaus have made free weekly reports available through AnnualCreditReport.com. This expanded access has been made permanent, meaning you can check your full credit report from any or all three bureaus every single week at no cost.

### How to Request Your Reports

1. Visit [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/) directly. Do not search for it — type the URL to avoid phishing sites.
2. Complete the request form with your name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth.
3. Select which bureau reports you want. You can request one, two, or all three at the same time.
4. Answer security verification questions (for example, confirming a past address or a loan you have had).
5. View or download your reports immediately.

Request reports from all three bureaus. Each bureau may have slightly different information, so reviewing all three gives you the most complete picture.

## Credit Score vs. Credit Report

These two terms are related but different, and understanding the distinction matters.

### Credit Report

Your credit report is a detailed document maintained by each of the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion). It contains your full credit history, including every credit account you have opened, your payment history on each account, current balances, credit limits, and any public records like bankruptcies or tax liens. It also lists inquiries — records of who has pulled your credit.

Think of your credit report as your complete academic transcript. It shows every course, every grade, every semester.

### Credit Score

Your credit score is a three-digit number, typically ranging from 300 to 850, that is calculated from the data in your credit report. Scoring models like FICO and VantageScore use algorithms to turn your credit history into a single number that represents your creditworthiness.

Think of your credit score as your GPA — a summary of your transcript compressed into one number.

### Why Both Matter

Your credit score gives you a quick snapshot of where you stand. Your credit report tells you why. If your score drops unexpectedly, your credit report will reveal the cause. If you find an error on your credit report and get it corrected, your score will improve accordingly. To truly understand and manage your credit, you need both. For a deeper look at what constitutes a [good credit score](/guides/what-is-good-credit-score), see our dedicated guide.

## Understanding Your Credit Score

Credit scores generally fall into five ranges. Where you land determines how lenders view your application and what interest rates you can expect.

### FICO Score Ranges

| Score Range | Rating | What It Means |
|---|---|---|
| 800 - 850 | Exceptional | Best rates and terms available. Easy approval for most credit products. |
| 740 - 799 | Very Good | Qualifies for very competitive rates. Well above the national average. |
| 670 - 739 | Good | Considered an acceptable borrower by most lenders. Near or above average. |
| 580 - 669 | Fair | Below average. May be approved but with higher interest rates. |
| 300 - 579 | Poor | Difficult to get approved for traditional credit. Higher rates and fees if approved. |

The average FICO score in the United States is around 715. If you are below that, there are concrete steps you can take to [improve your credit score](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score). If you need funding now and your credit is not where you want it to be, explore [loan options for lower credit scores](/loans/bad-credit).

Understanding these ranges is particularly important when you are about to apply for a loan. Even a small difference in score can result in meaningfully different interest rates and thousands of dollars in savings or extra costs over the life of a loan.

## What to Look for on Your Credit Report

Once you have your credit report, reviewing it carefully is essential. Here is what to check and the red flags to watch for.

### Personal Information

Verify your name, address, Social Security number, and employment information. Incorrect personal details could indicate a mixed credit file (your data merged with someone else's) or identity theft.

### Account Information

Review every account listed. For each account, confirm the following details are accurate: the creditor name, account number, date opened, credit limit or loan amount, current balance, and payment status.

### Payment History

Your payment history is the single most important factor in your credit score. Look for any late payments reported on your record. If you see a late payment that you believe you made on time, this is worth disputing.

### Public Records

This section includes bankruptcies, tax liens, and civil judgments. Verify that any listed items are actually yours and that the dates are correct, as older items should eventually fall off your report.

### Inquiries

You will see two types. Soft inquiries (such as checking your own credit or pre-approval offers) do not affect your score. Hard inquiries (from applying for credit) do affect your score. Check that you recognize every hard inquiry — an unfamiliar one could signal someone applied for credit using your identity.

### Red Flags to Watch For

- Accounts you do not recognize — possible identity theft
- Incorrect late payments — reporting errors happen more often than you think
- Wrong balances or credit limits — these affect your utilization ratio
- Duplicate accounts — the same debt listed twice inflates your obligations
- Accounts in collections that you have already paid or settled
- Incorrect dates — especially on negative items, since timing affects when they fall off

## How to Dispute Errors

If you find errors on your credit report, you have the right to dispute them. The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/) provides guidance and sample dispute letters to help you through this process.

### Step 1: Identify the Error

Be specific about what is wrong. Note the account name, account number, and exactly what information is inaccurate.

### Step 2: Gather Documentation

Collect any evidence that supports your dispute. This could include bank statements, payment receipts, correspondence with the creditor, or identity theft reports.

### Step 3: File Your Dispute

You can dispute errors with each credit bureau in three ways:

- **Online:** Each bureau has an online dispute portal (this is the fastest method)
- **By mail:** Send a written dispute letter with copies of supporting documents via certified mail
- **By phone:** Call the bureau directly, though written disputes create a better paper trail

File your dispute with every bureau that shows the error. An error on your Experian report will not automatically be corrected on your Equifax or TransUnion reports.

### Step 4: Wait for Investigation

By law, credit bureaus must investigate your dispute within 30 days (45 days in some circumstances). They will contact the creditor who reported the information and request verification.

### Step 5: Review the Results

The bureau will send you the results of the investigation in writing. If the error is confirmed, it will be corrected or removed. If the dispute is denied but you still believe the information is wrong, you can request that a statement of dispute be included in your file, escalate to the CFPB, or contact the creditor directly.

## How Your Credit Score Affects Loan Costs

Your credit score does not just affect whether you get approved — it directly determines how much you pay. Even a modest difference in score can translate to hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest charges.

Here is an example using a $5,000 personal loan with a 3-year term:

| Credit Score | Estimated APR | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid |
|---|---|---|---|
| 750+ (Excellent) | 7.99% | $156 | $636 |
| 680 (Good) | 14.99% | $173 | $1,237 |
| 620 (Fair) | 24.99% | $198 | $2,119 |
| 580 (Poor) | 35.99% | $222 | $2,981 |

<StatHighlight value="$2,345" label="extra interest paid on a $5,000 loan with poor credit (580) vs. excellent credit (750+)" icon="dollar" variant="red" />

The difference between excellent credit and poor credit on a $5,000 loan is over $2,300 in additional interest. On larger loans — like a mortgage or auto loan — the gap grows to tens of thousands of dollars.

This is why it pays to check your credit, fix any errors, and work on improvement before applying. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to see how different rates affect your total cost based on your specific borrowing needs.

## Next Steps

Checking your credit score is the starting point, not the finish line. Here is what to do next based on where you stand:

- **If your score is lower than expected:** Read our guide on [how to improve your credit score](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score) for actionable steps, from quick wins to long-term strategies.
- **If you found errors on your report:** Follow the dispute process outlined above and check back in 30 to 45 days to confirm corrections were made.
- **If you are not sure what a good score looks like:** Our guide on [what is a good credit score](/guides/what-is-good-credit-score) breaks down the ranges and what they mean for different types of borrowing.
- **If you need a loan and your credit is not perfect:** You still have options. Many lenders work with borrowers across the credit spectrum, including those with [fair or poor credit](/loans/bad-credit).

If you know your credit score and are ready to see what loan options are available to you, comparing offers from multiple lenders is the smartest next step. Checking rates with most lenders only requires a soft inquiry, so your score will not be affected.
