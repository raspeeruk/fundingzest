faqs:
  - question: "Should I take out a loan to pay medical bills?"
    answer: "A loan should generally be a last resort after you have exhausted free or low-cost options. First, verify the bill is accurate, ask the provider about financial assistance or charity care, negotiate the balance, and request a zero-interest payment plan directly from the hospital. If none of those options work and the bill is large enough to affect your credit or go to collections, a personal loan with a reasonable interest rate can be a better alternative than high-interest credit card debt."
  - question: "Do hospitals offer interest-free payment plans?"
    answer: "Many hospitals and large medical groups offer interest-free payment plans lasting 6 to 24 months. These are often available simply by calling the billing department and asking. Nonprofit hospitals are required by federal law to have financial assistance policies, and many for-profit providers offer similar arrangements. Always ask before assuming you need to borrow from a third party."
  - question: "How does medical debt affect my credit score?"
    answer: "As of 2023, the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — no longer report paid medical collections and exclude unpaid medical debt under $500. New unpaid medical debt does not appear on credit reports until it has been in collections for at least one year, giving you more time to resolve it. However, medical debt placed with a collection agency for amounts over $500 that remains unpaid after one year can still damage your score."
  - question: "Is CareCredit a good option for medical bills?"
    answer: "CareCredit can work well if you are confident you can pay the full balance within the promotional zero-interest period, which typically ranges from 6 to 24 months. However, if any balance remains when the promotional period ends, CareCredit charges deferred interest — meaning you owe retroactive interest on the entire original amount, often at rates above 26% APR. This makes it risky for anyone who is uncertain about paying in full on time."
  - question: "Can I negotiate my medical bills down?"
    answer: "Yes. Medical bills are frequently negotiable. Start by requesting an itemized bill and checking for errors — billing mistakes are common. Then ask the provider for a discount for paying in cash or in full, request the Medicare rate instead of the chargemaster rate, or propose a lower lump-sum settlement. Many providers will reduce a bill by 20% to 50% rather than risk sending it to collections where they recover even less."

An unexpected medical bill can feel like a financial emergency, and the pressure to pay quickly can push people toward borrowing options that make the situation worse. Before you sign a loan agreement or open a medical credit card, it is worth understanding every option available — because the best choice for medical debt is often not a loan at all.

This guide covers what to do before borrowing, how each financing option actually works, and where to find assistance programs that could reduce or eliminate your bill entirely.

## Before You Borrow: Steps That Could Save You Thousands

<StatHighlight value="80%" label="of medical bills contain errors — always request an itemized statement before paying" icon="warning" variant="red" />

Before you commit to any repayment strategy, work through these steps in order. Each one can reduce or eliminate the amount you ultimately need to pay.

### Step 1: Request an Itemized Bill and Check for Errors

Call the billing department and ask for a fully itemized statement — not just a summary. Review every line item for:

- **Duplicate charges** for the same procedure or test
- **Services you did not receive** (incorrect room charges, medications not administered)
- **Upcoding**, where a procedure is billed at a higher complexity level than what was performed
- **Out-of-network charges** for providers you did not choose (such as an anesthesiologist assigned by the hospital)

If you find errors, dispute them in writing with the billing department. This alone can reduce bills by hundreds or thousands of dollars.

### Step 2: Negotiate the Balance

Medical providers expect a percentage of patients to negotiate. The chargemaster rate — the sticker price on your bill — is rarely what insurance companies or large payers actually pay. You have leverage.

Effective negotiation strategies include:

- **Ask for the Medicare rate.** Medicare typically pays 40% to 60% less than chargemaster prices. Requesting this rate gives the provider a reference point that is still profitable for them.
- **Offer a lump-sum discount.** Many providers will accept 30% to 50% less if you can pay the reduced amount upfront or within 30 days.
- **Reference financial hardship.** If your income is limited, explain your situation. Providers often have discretion to reduce bills, especially if the alternative is sending the debt to collections (where they recover far less).

### Step 3: Apply for Financial Assistance and Charity Care

Nonprofit hospitals are legally required under IRS Section 501(r) to maintain a financial assistance policy (often called "charity care"). Many for-profit hospitals offer similar programs voluntarily.

Eligibility typically depends on income relative to the federal poverty level. Patients earning below 200% to 400% of the poverty level often qualify for significant reductions or complete write-offs.

**How to apply:**

1. Ask the billing department for the financial assistance application.
2. Submit proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns).
3. Wait for a determination — do not pay the full bill while your application is pending.

If the hospital does not offer adequate assistance, community organizations and nonprofits may help. The [211.org](https://www.211.org/) hotline connects callers with local financial assistance programs, including medical bill aid.

### Step 4: Check for Government Programs

Depending on your situation, you may qualify for:

- **Medicaid:** If your income is low enough, Medicaid may cover the bill retroactively. In most states, you can apply for Medicaid up to 90 days after receiving care. Visit [Healthcare.gov](https://www.cms.gov/marketplace) to check eligibility.
- **State and county assistance programs:** Many states and municipalities have programs that cover medical costs for uninsured or underinsured residents.
- **Veterans benefits:** If you are a veteran, the VA may cover medical expenses even for non-VA care in certain circumstances.

## Option 1: Hospital Payment Plans

If you still owe a balance after negotiating and applying for assistance, a payment plan directly with the hospital is almost always the best first option.

### How Hospital Payment Plans Work

Most hospitals will allow you to pay a remaining balance in monthly installments over 6 to 24 months. Many of these plans carry **zero interest**, especially from nonprofit providers. Even for-profit hospitals frequently offer interest-free terms for balances under $5,000 to $10,000.

### Advantages

- No credit check required in most cases
- No interest or low interest
- No impact on your credit score (as long as you make payments)
- Flexible monthly amounts based on what you can afford

### Disadvantages

- Not all providers offer them — smaller practices and physician groups may be less flexible
- If you default, the balance can be sent to collections
- The payment period may be shorter than what a loan would offer

**What to ask:** "Can I set up a monthly payment plan with no interest?" If they offer a plan with interest, ask what the rate is and compare it to the other options below.

## Option 2: Personal Loans

A personal [installment loan](/loans/installment) can be a reasonable option when the provider does not offer a payment plan, or when you need to consolidate multiple medical bills into a single payment.

### How Personal Loans Work for Medical Bills

You borrow a fixed amount, receive the funds, pay the medical provider, and repay the lender in equal monthly installments over a set term (typically 12 to 60 months). Interest rates depend on your credit score, income, and the lender.

### Advantages

- Fixed interest rate and predictable monthly payment
- Longer repayment terms available (up to 60 months)
- Can consolidate multiple medical bills into one payment
- No deferred interest risk

### Disadvantages

- Interest rates range from roughly 6% to 36% APR depending on creditworthiness
- Requires a credit check (hard inquiry)
- Origination fees of 1% to 8% may apply
- You are converting unsecured medical debt into a formal loan obligation

Personal loans make the most sense when you have good to fair credit (which qualifies you for lower rates) and the provider is not willing to offer a zero-interest payment plan. If your credit is lower, review options for [bad credit loans](/loans/bad-credit), but pay close attention to total cost.

Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to compare monthly payments and total interest across different loan amounts and terms before committing.

## Option 3: Medical Credit Cards

Medical credit cards like CareCredit and Prosper Healthcare Lending are specifically marketed for healthcare expenses. They are widely accepted by hospitals, dentists, veterinarians, and other providers.

### How Medical Credit Cards Work

These cards typically offer a **promotional zero-interest period** of 6, 12, 18, or 24 months. If you pay the full balance before the promotional period ends, you pay no interest. If you do not, you face **deferred interest**.

### The Deferred Interest Trap

<Callout type="cost" title="Deferred Interest Is Not the Same as Zero Interest">
If any balance remains when a promotional period ends, deferred interest charges you **retroactive interest on the entire original amount** — not just the remaining balance. A $500 remaining balance on a $4,000 charge could trigger $800+ in retroactive interest at 26%+ APR.
</Callout>

Deferred interest is fundamentally different from a standard zero-interest promotion. Here is how it works:

- You charge $4,000 for a medical procedure with a 12-month promotional period.
- You pay down $3,500 over 12 months, leaving a $500 balance.
- When the promotional period ends, the lender charges you retroactive interest on the **entire original $4,000** — not just the remaining $500 — at a rate that typically exceeds 26% APR.
- That $500 remaining balance could trigger $800 or more in retroactive interest charges.

This structure makes medical credit cards **high-risk for anyone who is not certain they can pay the full balance on time.**

### When Medical Credit Cards Make Sense

- You can realistically pay the full balance within the promotional period
- You set up automatic payments to ensure you never miss a month
- The promotional period is long enough to cover the balance at your payment pace

### When to Avoid Them

- You are uncertain about your ability to pay in full before the promotional period ends
- The balance is large relative to your monthly cash flow
- You tend to carry balances on other credit cards

## Option 4: Payday Loans — Not Recommended

Some borrowers facing urgent medical bills consider [payday loans](/loans/payday) because of their speed and minimal credit requirements. This is almost never a good decision for medical debt.

Payday loans carry APRs that frequently exceed 400%, require full repayment within two to four weeks, and create a cycle of reborrowing that makes the original medical debt look small by comparison.

Medical debt is unique: providers generally cannot refuse to treat you in an emergency, and medical collections now have a one-year grace period before appearing on credit reports. This means you almost always have time to pursue better options.

If you are considering a payday loan for medical bills, review our guide on [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) for safer options that are available on a similar timeline.

## Government and Nonprofit Assistance Programs

Beyond hospital charity care, several programs exist specifically to help with medical costs:

- **Hill-Burton Program:** Certain hospitals and facilities that received federal funding are obligated to provide free or reduced-cost care. The Health Resources and Services Administration maintains a list of obligated facilities.
- **Pharmaceutical assistance programs:** Drug manufacturers often provide free or discounted medications to patients who qualify. NeedyMeds and RxAssist maintain searchable databases.
- **Disease-specific nonprofits:** Organizations like the American Cancer Society, the National Kidney Foundation, and others provide financial assistance for treatment costs related to specific conditions.
- **State insurance programs:** Beyond Medicaid, many states offer programs for residents who earn too much to qualify for Medicaid but too little to afford private insurance.

The CFPB's [medical debt resource page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-should-i-do-if-i-have-medical-debt-en-1855/) provides additional guidance on managing medical bills and understanding your rights.

## How Medical Debt Is Treated by Credit Bureaus

Credit reporting rules for medical debt changed significantly in recent years, and the current rules are more favorable to consumers than many people realize:

| Rule | Details |
|---|---|
| **Paid medical collections** | No longer appear on credit reports from any of the three major bureaus |
| **Unpaid medical debt under $500** | Excluded from credit reports entirely |
| **Reporting delay** | Unpaid medical debt does not appear on credit reports until it has been in collections for at least 1 year |
| **Dispute rights** | You can dispute any medical collection that is inaccurate, and the bureau must investigate within 30 days |

These rules give you meaningful breathing room. A medical bill that goes to collections today will not affect your credit for at least a year — and if the balance is under $500 or you pay it before the year is up, it will not appear at all.

<Callout type="info" title="You Have More Time Than You Think">
Do not rush into a high-interest loan out of fear that a medical bill will immediately destroy your credit. Paid medical collections no longer appear on credit reports, debt under $500 is excluded entirely, and unpaid debt has a **one-year grace period** before it shows up. Use that time to negotiate, apply for assistance, or arrange a zero-interest payment plan.

## How to Compare Loan Offers for Medical Bills

If you decide that borrowing is the right path, compare offers carefully before signing. Focus on these factors:

1. **Total cost of the loan**, not just the monthly payment. A lower monthly payment over a longer term often means you pay significantly more in total interest.
2. **APR, not just interest rate.** The APR includes fees and gives you a true cost comparison.
3. **Origination fees.** Some lenders charge 1% to 8% upfront, which is deducted from your loan proceeds.
4. **Prepayment penalties.** Confirm you can pay off the loan early without extra charges.
5. **Late payment policies.** Understand the fee and whether a single late payment triggers a penalty rate.

Our guide on [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers) walks through this process in detail with a side-by-side comparison framework.

## Take the Next Step

Medical bills are stressful, but they are also among the most negotiable forms of debt. Before borrowing, exhaust every avenue to reduce the bill and secure a zero-interest arrangement directly with the provider. If a loan is the right choice for your situation, choose the option with the lowest total cost and a payment that fits comfortably within your monthly budget.
