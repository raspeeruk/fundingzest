faqs:
  - question: "Which is cheaper, a payday loan or an installment loan?"
    answer: "Installment loans are almost always cheaper than payday loans. Typical installment loan APRs range from 6% to 199%, while payday loan APRs range from 200% to 780%. For a $500 loan, a payday loan might cost $75-$150 in fees over 2 weeks, while an installment loan might cost $30-$80 in total interest over 3 months."
  - question: "Can I get either type of loan with bad credit?"
    answer: "Yes. Both payday loans and installment loans are available to borrowers with bad credit. Payday lenders typically have the lowest credit requirements — many perform no traditional credit check at all. Online installment lenders that specialize in bad credit may accept scores below 580 but usually charge higher APRs."
  - question: "Which type of loan is easier to get approved for?"
    answer: "Payday loans generally have the easiest approval process. Most payday lenders only require proof of income, an active bank account, and valid ID. Installment loans may require additional documentation and a soft or hard credit check, though approval rates remain high with online lenders."
  - question: "Can a payday loan or installment loan help build my credit?"
    answer: "Installment loans are much more likely to build credit because most installment lenders report to credit bureaus. Payday lenders rarely report to major credit bureaus. However, if you default on either type of loan and it goes to collections, it can damage your credit."
  - question: "What if I need money today — which is faster?"
    answer: "Both can be fast. Many payday lenders and online installment lenders offer approval within minutes and next-business-day funding. Some payday lenders offer same-day funding if you apply early. The speed difference is minimal with online lenders."

## The Key Differences at a Glance

If you need to borrow money and are weighing your options, understanding the fundamental differences between payday loans and installment loans is the most important first step. These two products serve different needs, carry different costs, and affect your financial health in different ways.

The following table summarizes the major differences.

| Feature | Payday Loans | Installment Loans |
|---|---|---|
| **Loan Amounts** | $100 – $1,000 | $500 – $35,000 |
| **Repayment Structure** | Single lump-sum payment | Equal monthly payments |
| **Repayment Term** | 2 – 4 weeks | 3 – 60 months |
| **Typical APR** | 200% – 780% | 6% – 199% |
| **Pricing Model** | Flat fee per $100 borrowed | Interest rate (APR) |
| **Credit Check** | Usually none | Soft or hard inquiry |
| **Approval Speed** | Minutes to hours | Minutes to 1 business day |
| **Funding Speed** | Same day to next business day | Next business day to 5 days |
| **Credit Building** | Rarely (most do not report) | Yes (most report to bureaus) |
| **State Availability** | Banned or restricted in many states | Available in most states |
| **Rollover Risk** | High | Low |
| **Best For** | Very small, very short-term needs | Larger amounts, longer repayment, credit building |

The core takeaway: **installment loans cost less, offer more flexibility, and provide more borrower protections** than payday loans in nearly every scenario. However, payday loans may be easier to qualify for and can provide very fast access to small amounts of cash when other options are unavailable.

## How Payday Loans Work

A [payday loan](/loans/payday) is a short-term, small-dollar loan designed to be repaid in full on your next payday. Here is how the process typically works.

You borrow a small amount — usually **$100 to $1,000** — and agree to repay the entire balance plus a flat fee within **two to four weeks**. The fee is typically **$10 to $30 per $100 borrowed**. When the loan comes due, the lender collects the full amount from your bank account or you pay in person at a storefront.

For example, if you borrow $400 with a $15-per-$100 fee, you owe **$460** on your next payday. That $60 fee may seem modest, but expressed as an APR (which accounts for the short repayment period), it translates to roughly **391%** — far higher than most other consumer lending products.

The biggest risk with payday loans is the **debt cycle**. If you cannot afford the lump-sum repayment on your payday, you may roll the loan over or take out a new loan to cover the original one. Each rollover adds new fees. According to the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/payday-loans/), more than 80% of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days.

For a more detailed breakdown, read our guide on [how payday loans work](/guides/how-payday-loans-work).

## How Installment Loans Work

An [installment loan](/loans/installment) is a loan where you borrow a fixed amount and repay it in **equal monthly payments** over a set period. Each payment includes a portion of the principal (the amount you borrowed) plus interest.

Loan amounts typically range from **$500 to $35,000** with repayment terms of **3 to 60 months**. The interest rate is expressed as an APR, which for personal installment loans typically falls between **6% and 199%** depending on your credit profile.

For example, if you borrow $2,000 at 36% APR with a 12-month term, your monthly payment would be approximately **$202**, and you would pay about **$424** in total interest over the life of the loan. The key advantage is that you know your exact payment amount each month and can plan your budget accordingly.

Most installment lenders report your payment history to major credit bureaus, meaning on-time payments help you build a positive credit history. This is a significant benefit that payday loans almost never offer.

## Cost Comparison: Real Dollar Amounts

Cost is the most compelling reason to choose an installment loan over a payday loan. The difference is not marginal — it is substantial at every borrowing level.

### What Does a $500 Loan Actually Cost?

**Payday loan scenario:** You borrow $500 with a $15-per-$100 fee, due in 2 weeks. You owe $575. If you cannot repay on time and roll over twice (an additional 4 weeks), you pay the $75 fee three times for a total cost of **$225** in fees on a $500 loan — and you still owe the $500 principal.

**Installment loan scenario:** You borrow $500 at 36% APR with a 6-month term. Your monthly payment is approximately **$87**. Your total interest over 6 months is roughly **$52**. The loan is fully paid off at the end, with no remaining balance.

The installment loan costs **$52**. The payday loan — even without rollovers — costs **$75**, and with two rollovers costs **$225**. That is a difference of more than 4x.

### Cost Comparison Across Multiple Loan Amounts

The following table compares the cost of payday loans versus installment loans at common borrowing amounts.

| Loan Amount | Payday Loan Fee (2 weeks, $15/$100) | Payday Loan APR | Installment Loan Total Interest (36% APR, 6 months) | Installment Loan Total Interest (72% APR, 6 months) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **$300** | $45 | 391% | $31 | $64 |
| **$500** | $75 | 391% | $52 | $107 |
| **$1,000** | $150 | 391% | $104 | $214 |
| **$2,000** | N/A (exceeds payday limits) | N/A | $208 | $428 |

Even when comparing a payday loan to a **higher-APR installment loan** at 72%, the installment loan is cheaper for amounts of $500 or less — and the gap widens with rollovers. For amounts above $1,000, payday loans are generally not available at all, making installment loans the only option.

These numbers assume no rollovers for the payday loan. In practice, rollovers are common and multiply the cost significantly. You can run your own numbers using our [loan calculator](/calculator).

## Repayment Structure: Why It Matters

The repayment structure is one of the most important — and most overlooked — differences between these two loan types.

### Payday Loans: Lump-Sum Repayment

Payday loans require you to repay the **entire principal plus fees in a single payment**. For a $500 loan with a $75 fee, you must have $575 available on your next payday. For many borrowers, this lump-sum requirement creates a cash shortfall that leads to reborrowing.

Consider this: if you needed to borrow $500 because your budget was tight, having to repay $575 in two weeks often means your next paycheck is $575 short — putting you right back where you started, or worse. This is the **payday loan debt cycle**, and it is the primary reason consumer advocates and regulators have raised concerns about payday lending.

### Installment Loans: Monthly Payments

Installment loans spread repayment across **multiple smaller payments**. That same $500 at 36% APR over 6 months requires only about **$87 per month**. This is a much more manageable amount to work into a monthly budget.

The predictability of fixed monthly payments also makes it easier to plan ahead. You know exactly how much to set aside each month and exactly when the loan will be paid off. There is no ambiguity, no balloon payment, and no surprise fees — as long as you pay on time.

### The Debt Cycle Risk

Research consistently shows that the lump-sum repayment model of payday loans creates a significantly higher risk of reborrowing. When borrowers cannot afford the full repayment, they either roll the loan over (paying another fee to extend the due date) or take out a new loan immediately after repaying the first.

Installment loans carry a much lower rollover risk because the monthly payment is designed to be a manageable fraction of your income. While it is still possible to fall behind on payments, the structure itself does not create the same cycle of repeated borrowing.

## Credit Requirements Compared

### Payday Loan Credit Requirements

Payday lenders typically have **minimal credit requirements**. Most do not perform a traditional credit check through Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion. Instead, they verify your income and bank account status. The primary requirements are:

- **Proof of regular income** (pay stubs, bank statements, or benefits documentation)
- **An active checking account**
- **Valid government-issued ID**
- **Being at least 18 years old**

This low barrier to entry is one reason payday loans appeal to borrowers with poor or no credit history. However, the trade-off is the high cost and limited credit-building benefit.

### Installment Loan Credit Requirements

Installment lenders generally perform a **soft or hard credit inquiry** as part of the application process. Credit requirements vary widely:

- **Traditional banks and credit unions:** Usually require scores of **670 or higher**
- **Online lenders (prime):** May accept scores of **600 to 669**
- **Online lenders (subprime):** May accept scores of **580 or lower**, with some having no minimum score requirement

Even if you have bad credit, many online installment lenders specialize in working with borrowers who do not qualify at traditional institutions. The APR will be higher, but the product still offers structural advantages over payday loans.

### How Each Type Affects Your Credit

This is a critical distinction. **Most payday lenders do not report to major credit bureaus.** This means that even if you repay your payday loan perfectly, it will not help your credit score. On the other hand, if you default and the debt goes to collections, it **can** appear on your credit report and damage your score.

**Most installment lenders report to at least one major bureau.** This means every on-time payment contributes to a positive payment history — the single largest factor in your credit score. Over time, consistently paying an installment loan on schedule can meaningfully improve your creditworthiness and help you qualify for better financial products.

## When to Choose a Payday Loan

Payday loans are not the best choice in most situations, but there are narrow scenarios where they may make sense:

- **You need a very small amount** — under $300 — for a genuine emergency and no other option is available.
- **You are absolutely certain** you can repay in full on your next payday without creating a new shortfall in your budget.
- **You have been declined** for installment loans, credit union loans, and other alternatives.
- **You need same-day cash** and a storefront payday lender is your only option for immediate funding.

Even in these scenarios, explore alternatives before committing. The cost of a payday loan is high, and the risk of reborrowing is real. If you do take a payday loan, have a concrete plan for full repayment on the due date.

## When to Choose an Installment Loan

Installment loans are the stronger choice in most borrowing situations. Consider an installment loan when:

- **You need more than $500.** Payday loans are typically capped at $500 to $1,000. Installment loans offer access to much larger amounts.
- **You need time to repay.** If you cannot realistically repay the full amount on your next payday, an installment loan lets you spread payments over 3 to 60 months.
- **You want to build or rebuild credit.** Installment loans reported to credit bureaus provide a pathway to improving your credit score through on-time payments.
- **You want a lower overall cost.** Even a higher-APR installment loan typically costs less than a payday loan, especially when rollovers are factored in.
- **You prefer predictable budgeting.** Knowing your exact monthly payment amount makes financial planning easier and reduces the chance of being caught off guard.
- **You want to consolidate existing debt.** An installment loan can roll multiple high-cost debts into one payment at a potentially lower rate.

## What About Other Options?

Before choosing either a payday loan or an installment loan, consider whether another option might be a better fit.

### Credit Union Payday Alternative Loans (PALs)

If you are a member of a federal credit union, you may qualify for a **Payday Alternative Loan (PAL)**. These loans are regulated by the [National Credit Union Administration](https://www.ncua.gov/consumers/payday-alternative-loans) and offer:

- Loan amounts of **$200 to $2,000**
- Repayment terms of **1 to 12 months**
- **Maximum APR of 28%** — far below typical payday loan rates
- Application fees capped at **$20**

PALs are one of the most affordable short-term borrowing options available, but you must be a credit union member to qualify.

### Cash Advance Apps

Apps like Earnin, Dave, and Brigit allow you to access a portion of your earned wages before payday. Advance amounts are typically **$50 to $500**, and the cost may be a small subscription fee, an optional tip, or a fast-funding fee rather than traditional interest. These can work well for very small, very short-term cash needs.

### Credit Card Cash Advances

If you have a credit card with available credit, a cash advance provides immediate access to funds. Cash advance APRs are high — typically **25% to 30%** — and interest begins accruing immediately with no grace period. However, this is still significantly cheaper than a payday loan. Be aware that cash advance fees (typically 3% to 5% of the amount) apply on top of the interest.

### Negotiating With Creditors

If you need money to cover a specific bill, contact the creditor directly. Many utility companies, medical providers, and landlords offer **payment plans, hardship programs, or extensions** that could eliminate the need to borrow at all.

For a comprehensive overview of alternatives, see our guide on [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives).

## The Verdict: Which Is Better?

For the vast majority of borrowers, **installment loans are the better choice**. They cost less, offer more manageable repayment terms, provide credit-building opportunities, and carry a much lower risk of trapping you in a cycle of debt.

Payday loans serve a narrow purpose — providing very small amounts of cash very quickly to borrowers who have no other options and can repay in full within two weeks. Outside of that narrow window, the costs and risks outweigh the convenience.

Here is a simple decision framework:

- **Need more than $500?** Choose an installment loan.
- **Need more than 2 weeks to repay?** Choose an installment loan.
- **Want to build credit?** Choose an installment loan.
- **Want the lowest total cost?** Choose an installment loan.
- **Need less than $300 immediately and can repay on your next payday?** A payday loan is an option, but explore PALs and cash advance apps first.
