faqs:
  - question: "How fast can I improve my credit score?"
    answer: "Some actions can improve your score within 30 days — like paying down credit card balances (reducing utilization) or getting errors removed from your report. Others take months: building payment history, aging your accounts, and diversifying your credit mix. Realistic expectations are a 20-50 point improvement in 1-3 months for quick wins, and 50-100+ points over 6-12 months with sustained effort."
  - question: "What hurts my credit score the most?"
    answer: "The biggest negative factors are: late payments (35% of your FICO score), high credit utilization (30%), collections and charge-offs, bankruptcy and foreclosure, and too many hard inquiries in a short period. A single 30-day late payment can drop your score by 60-110 points."
  - question: "Does paying off collections improve my score?"
    answer: "It depends on the scoring model. FICO 9 and VantageScore 3.0/4.0 ignore paid collections entirely, which helps your score. Older FICO models (still used by many lenders) do not remove paid collections from the calculation. Regardless, paying collections prevents further damage and may be required for loan approval."
  - question: "Can I pay someone to fix my credit?"
    answer: "Credit repair companies charge fees to dispute items on your credit report, but you can do everything they do for free yourself. The FTC warns that many credit repair companies are scams. Legitimate nonprofit credit counseling (through NFCC) is available for free or low cost. Never pay for something you can do yourself through AnnualCreditReport.com and the credit bureaus."
  - question: "How long do negative items stay on my credit report?"
    answer: "Most negative items remain for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. Bankruptcy stays for 7-10 years (Chapter 7: 10 years, Chapter 13: 7 years). Hard inquiries stay for 2 years but only impact your score for about 12 months. Positive information stays indefinitely or for 10 years after an account is closed."
  - question: "Does closing a credit card help or hurt my score?"
    answer: "Closing a credit card usually hurts your score because it reduces your available credit (increasing utilization ratio) and can lower your average account age. Keep cards open even if you don't use them regularly, especially your oldest cards. The exception: if a card has a high annual fee and you can't justify the cost."

Improving your credit score is one of the most impactful things you can do for your financial health. A higher score unlocks lower interest rates, better loan terms, and easier approvals — saving you hundreds or even thousands of dollars. The good news is that credit improvement does not require a financial advisor or expensive credit repair services. With the right strategy, you can start seeing results in as little as 30 days.

This guide lays out 10 proven steps, organized from the fastest quick wins to longer-term strategies that build lasting credit strength. Whether you are starting from a [poor credit score](/loans/bad-credit) or simply want to move from good to excellent, these steps work.

## What Affects Your Credit Score

Before you can improve your score, you need to understand what drives it. The FICO scoring model — used by 90% of top lenders — weighs five factors, each with a different impact on your final number.

### The 5 FICO Score Factors

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Payment History | 35% | Whether you pay your bills on time. Late payments, collections, and bankruptcies hurt. |
| Credit Utilization | 30% | How much of your available credit you are using. Lower is better. |
| Length of Credit History | 15% | The age of your oldest account, newest account, and average age across all accounts. |
| Credit Mix | 10% | The variety of credit types you manage — credit cards, installment loans, mortgages, etc. |
| New Credit | 10% | Recent hard inquiries and newly opened accounts. Too many in a short period signals risk. |

**Payment history and credit utilization together account for 65% of your score.** That is where you should focus your efforts first. These two factors also happen to be the ones you can influence most quickly.

Understanding these factors helps you prioritize your efforts. If you have never missed a payment but your score is still lower than expected, high credit utilization is likely the culprit. If your utilization is low but your score stalled, your credit history may be too short or too thin. Knowing your starting point matters — [check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free) before you begin so you can measure your progress.

## Quick Wins: Improve Your Score in 30 Days

These five strategies can produce measurable results within a single billing cycle. If you need to boost your score before applying for a [loan](/apply) or rental, start here.

### 1. Pay Down Credit Card Balances

Credit utilization — the percentage of your available credit that you are currently using — is the second most important factor in your score, and it is also the factor you can change the fastest. Your utilization is recalculated every time your credit card issuer reports your balance to the bureaus, which typically happens once per month on your statement closing date.

**The targets:** Keep your overall utilization below 30% at an absolute minimum. Below 10% is ideal for the best scores. Per-card utilization matters too, so avoid maxing out any single card even if your overall utilization is low.

**Example:** If you have two credit cards with a combined credit limit of $10,000, keeping your total balances below $1,000 (10%) is ideal. A balance of $3,000 or more (30%+) is actively hurting your score.

**The strategy:** If you are carrying balances, make a payment before your statement closing date — not just before the due date. This ensures a lower balance is reported to the bureaus. Even if you pay your bill in full every month, a high balance on your statement date can still result in high reported utilization.

### 2. Dispute Errors on Your Credit Report

The FTC found that 1 in 4 credit reports contain errors that could affect scores. Some of these errors are minor, but others — a late payment that was actually on time, an account that is not yours, a wrong balance — can significantly drag your score down.

Pull your free credit reports from [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/) and review each one carefully. If you find errors, file a dispute with the bureau reporting the incorrect information. The bureau must investigate within 30 days. Successful disputes can result in score improvements that show up on your next update.

Our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free) walks through the full dispute process step by step.

### 3. Become an Authorized User

If someone you trust — a parent, spouse, or close family member — has a credit card with a long history of on-time payments and low utilization, ask if they will add you as an authorized user. When they do, that card's entire payment history typically gets added to your credit report.

This strategy works best when the primary cardholder has excellent credit habits and the account has a long history. You do not even need to use the card or have it in your possession. The account's positive history will bolster your payment history and may reduce your overall utilization ratio.

**Important caveats:** Not all card issuers report authorized user accounts to all three bureaus — check before proceeding. And if the primary cardholder misses payments or carries high balances, that negative activity will hurt your score too. Choose your partners wisely.

### 4. Request a Credit Limit Increase

A higher credit limit reduces your utilization ratio without requiring you to pay down any debt. If you have a credit card you have managed responsibly — on-time payments, no recent delinquencies — call the issuer and ask for a limit increase.

**Example:** If your balance is $2,000 on a card with a $5,000 limit, your utilization on that card is 40%. If the issuer raises your limit to $10,000, that same $2,000 balance drops your utilization to 20% — an improvement that the scoring model rewards.

Some issuers grant increases with a soft pull (no impact on your score). Others require a hard pull. Ask before you agree so you can make an informed decision. A hard inquiry typically costs your score 3 to 5 points temporarily, which is usually worth it if you get a meaningful limit increase.

### 5. Ask for Goodwill Removal of Late Payments

If you have an otherwise strong payment history but one or two late payments are dragging your score down, a goodwill letter to the creditor can sometimes get them removed. This is not a guaranteed strategy — creditors are not obligated to do it — but it works more often than people think, especially if you have been a loyal customer and the late payment was an anomaly.

Write a brief, polite letter (or call) explaining the circumstances of the late payment, emphasizing your otherwise strong history with the creditor, and asking if they would consider removing the negative mark as a goodwill gesture. Be honest and concise. If the first representative says no, try again — different representatives may have different levels of authority.

A single late payment removal can boost your score by 20 to 50 points or more, depending on your overall credit profile.

## Long-Term Strategies: Build Credit Over 3-12 Months

Quick wins can move the needle fast, but lasting credit improvement requires consistent habits over time. These five strategies build the kind of credit history that keeps your score climbing month after month.

### 6. Set Up Autopay on All Accounts

<StatHighlight value="60–110 pts" label="score drop from a single missed payment — the mark stays on your report for 7 years" icon="trending-down" variant="red" />

Payment history is 35% of your score, making it the single most important factor. One missed payment can drop your score by 60 to 110 points, and that negative mark stays on your report for seven years. The simplest way to protect yourself is to automate every bill.

Set up autopay for at least the minimum payment on every account — credit cards, [installment loans](/loans/installment), utilities, and any other accounts that report to the bureaus. If you can afford it, set autopay for the full balance on credit cards to avoid interest charges and keep utilization low.

Even with autopay in place, check your accounts periodically to make sure payments are processing correctly and that you have sufficient funds in your bank account to cover them. A declined autopay due to insufficient funds still counts as a missed payment.

### 7. Get a Credit-Builder Loan

A credit-builder loan is designed specifically for people building or rebuilding credit. Instead of receiving the loan funds upfront, the lender holds them in a savings account while you make monthly payments. Once you finish paying, you receive the funds. Your on-time payments get reported to the credit bureaus, building your payment history.

Credit-builder loans are offered by many credit unions, community banks, and online lenders. The loan amounts are typically small — $300 to $1,000 — and the terms are usually 6 to 24 months. The cost is minimal, and the credit-building benefit is significant, especially if you have a thin credit file. Learn more in our guide on [credit-builder loans](/guides/credit-builder-loans).

### 8. Use a Secured Credit Card Responsibly

A secured credit card requires a refundable security deposit that typically serves as your credit limit. Because the deposit reduces the lender's risk, secured cards are available to people with poor or no credit history.

The key is using the card responsibly: make small purchases, keep utilization below 10% of your limit, and pay the balance in full every month. After 6 to 12 months of positive history, many issuers will upgrade you to an unsecured card and return your deposit.

Look for a secured card that reports to all three credit bureaus — not all of them do. Avoid cards with excessive fees. The goal is building credit, not paying unnecessary costs.

### 9. Diversify Your Credit Mix

Credit mix accounts for 10% of your FICO score. Lenders want to see that you can manage different types of credit responsibly. The two main types are:

- **Revolving credit:** Credit cards and lines of credit (balances fluctuate)
- **Installment credit:** Loans with fixed payments over a set term (personal loans, auto loans, mortgages, student loans)

If you only have credit cards, adding an installment loan — such as a credit-builder loan or a small [personal loan](/apply) — can improve your credit mix. If you only have installment loans, a secured credit card adds revolving credit to your profile. Do not open new accounts solely for the sake of credit mix — it is only 10% of your score. But if you are considering a new credit product anyway, choosing one that diversifies your mix provides an added benefit.

### 10. Keep Old Accounts Open

The length of your credit history makes up 15% of your score. This includes the age of your oldest account, the age of your newest account, and the average age across all accounts. Closing old accounts — especially your oldest credit card — shortens your history and can hurt your score.

Even if you no longer use a credit card, keeping it open benefits your score in two ways: it preserves your credit history length, and it maintains your total available credit (keeping utilization lower).

If you are worried about annual fees, call the issuer and ask to downgrade to a no-fee card instead of closing the account. If you are worried about fraud on an unused card, set up a small recurring charge (like a streaming subscription) and autopay the balance.

## Credit Score Improvement Timeline

Improving your credit score is a marathon, not a sprint. Here is what realistic progress looks like with consistent effort:

| Timeframe | Actions | Expected Improvement |
|---|---|---|
| 30 Days | Pay down card balances, dispute errors, become authorized user | 20 - 50 points |
| 90 Days | Continue low utilization, all payments on time, limit increases | 30 - 70 points |
| 6 Months | Sustained on-time payments, credit-builder loan progress, mix diversification | 50 - 100 points |
| 12 Months | All of the above, plus account aging, negative items further in the past | 70 - 150+ points |

These ranges assume you are actively implementing the strategies in this guide. Your individual results will depend on your starting point, the specific issues on your report, and how consistently you apply these steps. Someone starting at 520 with errors on their report may see dramatic gains. Someone at 720 looking to reach 780 will see slower, steadier improvement.

## Common Mistakes That Hurt Your Score

Knowing what to do is only half the equation. Avoiding these common mistakes is equally important.

### Closing Old Credit Cards

As discussed above, closing a credit card reduces your available credit (raising utilization) and can lower your average account age. Both effects hurt your score. Unless the card has an annual fee you cannot justify, keep it open.

### Applying for Too Much Credit at Once

Each hard inquiry from a credit application can reduce your score by 3 to 5 points. More importantly, multiple applications in a short period signal to lenders that you may be desperate for credit — a red flag. Space out credit applications and only apply when you have a genuine need.

The exception: rate shopping for a mortgage, auto loan, or student loan. FICO treats multiple inquiries of the same type within a 14-to-45-day window as a single inquiry, recognizing that you are comparison shopping, not seeking multiple loans.

### Only Paying Minimums

Paying the minimum keeps you current (protecting your payment history), but it does almost nothing to reduce your balance. If you are carrying high balances, the interest charges can actually cause your balance to grow. High balances mean high utilization, which drags your score down. Pay as much over the minimum as you can afford, targeting the highest-interest cards first.

### Ignoring Your Credit Report

You cannot fix what you do not know about. Many people go years without checking their credit report, allowing errors, fraud, and negative items to accumulate unchecked. Check your reports from all three bureaus regularly through [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). Weekly reports are now free. There is no excuse not to look.

### Falling for Credit Repair Scams

<Callout type="warning" title="Credit Repair Scams">
The FTC warns consumers about companies that charge upfront fees to "fix" your credit. These companies cannot do anything you cannot do for free yourself. **If a company guarantees a specific score increase or promises to remove accurate negative information, it is a scam.** Use free resources like AnnualCreditReport.com and NFCC nonprofit counseling instead.

## How Your Score Affects Loan Costs

Improving your credit score is not an abstract goal — it translates directly into real money saved. <ComparisonRow title="$5,000 Loan: Excellent vs. Poor Credit" options={[
  { title: "Poor Credit (580)", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "APR", value: "35.99%" }, { label: "Monthly Payment", value: "$222" }, { label: "Total Interest", value: "$2,981" }] },
  { title: "Excellent Credit (750+)", variant: "green", recommended: true, stats: [{ label: "APR", value: "7.99%" }, { label: "Monthly Payment", value: "$156" }, { label: "Total Interest", value: "$636" }] }
]} />

Here is how different credit scores affect the cost of a $5,000 personal loan with a 3-year repayment term:

| Credit Score | Estimated APR | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid | Savings vs. 580 Score |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 750+ (Excellent) | 7.99% | $156 | $636 | $2,345 |
| 680 (Good) | 14.99% | $173 | $1,237 | $1,744 |
| 620 (Fair) | 24.99% | $198 | $2,119 | $862 |
| 580 (Poor) | 35.99% | $222 | $2,981 | $0 |

<StatHighlight value="$2,345" label="interest saved on a $5,000 loan by improving your score from 580 to 750" icon="dollar" variant="green" />

Moving from a 580 credit score to 750 saves you $2,345 in interest on just a $5,000 loan. Scale that up to larger amounts — a $15,000 car loan or a $250,000 mortgage — and the savings become life-changing.

Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to see how different rates would affect your specific borrowing situation. Even small improvements in your score can lead to meaningfully better loan terms.

Understanding [what qualifies as a good credit score](/guides/what-is-good-credit-score) for different lending products can help you set the right target for your improvement efforts.

## Ready to Explore Loan Options?

If you have been working on improving your credit and want to see what rates you qualify for, comparing offers from multiple lenders is the smart next step. Many lenders allow you to check your rate with a soft inquiry — meaning no impact on your credit score.

Whether your credit is already strong or still a work in progress, there are lending options available. Borrowers with [lower credit scores](/loans/bad-credit) can still find competitive offers by comparing multiple lenders rather than accepting the first approval they receive.
