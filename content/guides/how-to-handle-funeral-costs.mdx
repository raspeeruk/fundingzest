  - question: "How much does a funeral cost on average?"
    answer: "The average funeral cost in the United States is approximately $7,848 for a viewing and burial, or $6,971 for a cremation with viewing, according to the National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA). However, costs vary significantly by region and services selected. A direct cremation (no viewing or ceremony) can cost as little as $1,000-$2,000."
  - question: "Can I negotiate funeral costs?"
    answer: "Yes. The FTC's Funeral Rule requires funeral homes to provide an itemized price list so you can choose only the services you want. You are not required to purchase a casket or other items from the funeral home — you can buy caskets online for significantly less. Always compare prices from 2-3 funeral homes."
  - question: "Are there programs that help pay for funerals?"
    answer: "Yes. Options include: FEMA funeral assistance (for COVID-related deaths), Social Security death benefit ($255), VA burial benefits for veterans ($2,000+), state/county burial assistance programs, crowdfunding (GoFundMe), church and community organization help, and some employers offer bereavement assistance."
  - question: "Should I take out a loan for funeral expenses?"
    answer: "Consider all alternatives first: funeral home payment plans, crowdfunding, family contributions, and assistance programs. If you must borrow, a personal installment loan is better than a payday loan or funeral home financing (which can have high interest rates). Only borrow what you can realistically repay."
  - question: "Does life insurance cover funeral costs?"
    answer: "If the deceased had life insurance, the death benefit can cover funeral costs. However, payouts typically take 30-60 days. Some policies have an accelerated death benefit option. Check with the insurance company about expedited payment or an advance for funeral expenses."

Losing a loved one is one of the most difficult experiences anyone faces. Having to figure out how to pay for a funeral in the middle of grief makes it worse. The average funeral in the United States costs nearly $8,000, and most families are expected to pay before or at the time of service. If the death was unexpected and there is no life insurance or savings set aside, families are often left scrambling for thousands of dollars within days.

This guide walks you through the full cost picture, your legal rights as a consumer, practical ways to reduce expenses, financial assistance programs that exist specifically for this situation, and borrowing options if you need them. You do not have to go into serious debt to give your loved one a dignified farewell.

## Understanding Funeral Costs

Funeral costs in the United States range from roughly $1,000 for a basic direct cremation to $15,000 or more for a full-service burial with all the traditional elements. The National Funeral Directors Association (NFDA) puts the median cost of a funeral with viewing and burial at $7,848, or $6,971 for a funeral with cremation.

The reason the bill gets so high is that a funeral is not a single purchase. It is a bundle of separate products and services, each with its own price, that add up quickly:

| Cost Component | Typical Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Funeral home basic services fee | $2,000 - $3,500 | Non-declinable fee covering staff, facilities, and coordination |
| Embalming | $500 - $1,000 | Not legally required in most states |
| Viewing/visitation | $400 - $1,000 | Facility use for one or two days |
| Funeral ceremony | $400 - $800 | Officiant, facility, coordination |
| Transfer of remains | $300 - $600 | Transport from place of death to funeral home |
| Casket | $1,000 - $10,000 | Largest single variable cost; can purchase independently |
| Burial vault or grave liner | $1,000 - $3,000 | Required by many cemeteries, not by law |
| Cemetery plot | $1,000 - $4,000 | Varies dramatically by location |
| Headstone/grave marker | $500 - $3,000 | Can be purchased later to spread costs |
| Flowers, programs, obituary | $200 - $1,000 | Often purchased separately |
| **Total (full traditional burial)** | **$7,000 - $15,000+** | |

The basic services fee is charged by virtually every funeral home and covers their overhead, staff time, and coordination of all arrangements. It is typically non-negotiable. Everything else on the list, however, is optional or can be sourced independently.

## Your Rights Under the FTC Funeral Rule

The Federal Trade Commission's [Funeral Rule](https://www.ftc.gov/consumer-advice/shopping-buying/buying-funeral-services) is one of the most important consumer protections you have during this process. It exists specifically because the funeral industry historically pressured grieving families into expensive, unnecessary purchases. Here is what the rule guarantees:

**You must receive an itemized price list.** Every funeral home is required to provide a General Price List (GPL) that shows the cost of every individual service and product. This must be given to you at the beginning of any in-person discussion. Over the phone, funeral homes must provide prices for any item you ask about. This allows you to compare costs across funeral homes and select only what you want.

**You can buy your own casket or urn.** You are not required to purchase a casket from the funeral home. Online retailers like Costco, Walmart, and specialty casket websites sell caskets for $500 to $2,000 — often 50% to 70% less than funeral home prices. The funeral home cannot refuse to use a casket you purchased elsewhere, and they cannot charge a handling fee for accepting it.

**You choose only the services you want.** Except for the basic services fee, you are not required to buy any specific package or bundle. Funeral homes cannot tell you that any particular combination of goods and services is required by law unless it actually is — and most of it is not.

**Embalming is not required in most cases.** Funeral homes cannot tell you that embalming is legally required unless state law specifically mandates it (most states do not). Embalming is generally only necessary if you choose an open-casket viewing with a delayed burial. For cremation, direct burial, or immediate services, it is an unnecessary expense.

**You can get prices by phone.** You do not have to visit a funeral home in person to get their prices. The Funeral Rule requires them to provide pricing information over the phone, which makes it possible to compare costs from home during a time when in-person visits may feel overwhelming.

Use these rights. Request the itemized price list from two or three funeral homes before making any decisions. Even a 20-minute comparison call can save $1,000 or more.

## Ways to Reduce Funeral Costs

Reducing costs does not mean reducing dignity. Many of the most expensive funeral elements are traditions or industry upsells, not requirements. Here are practical approaches that families use to bring costs down significantly:

**Choose direct cremation.** At $1,000 to $2,000, direct cremation is the most affordable option. The body is cremated without a viewing or ceremony. You can hold a memorial service separately — at a park, a home, a place of worship — on your own timeline and at minimal cost. A memorial does not require a funeral home.

**Buy the casket independently.** If you choose burial, purchase the casket online. Costco sells caskets for $950 to $1,500. Walmart's online selection ranges from $800 to $3,000. Specialty sites like Titan Casket offer direct-to-consumer pricing. The savings compared to funeral home pricing can be $2,000 to $5,000.

**Compare funeral homes.** Prices vary substantially between funeral homes, even in the same city. The FTC requires them to provide prices over the phone. Call two or three, request the General Price List, and compare. This is the single easiest way to reduce costs by hundreds or thousands of dollars.

**Skip optional services.** Embalming ($500-$1,000), deluxe flower arrangements ($300-$800), printed programs ($150-$400), and newspaper obituaries ($200-$1,500) are all optional. A simple service with meaningful words costs far less than an elaborate production and can be equally or more personal.

**Consider a natural burial.** Natural or "green" burial grounds skip the vault, use a biodegradable casket or shroud, and do not require embalming. Costs are typically $1,000 to $4,000 total — less than half of a conventional burial. The Green Burial Council maintains a directory of certified natural burial grounds.

**Donate the body to science.** Medical schools and research programs accept body donations and typically handle all transportation and cremation costs. Remains (cremated) are usually returned to the family within one to two years. Programs like MedCure and Science Care facilitate the process. This option costs the family nothing.

**Hold the memorial separately.** You do not need the funeral home for a memorial service. A gathering at home, a park, a community center, or a place of worship can be organized at minimal cost and on your own schedule — weeks or even months after the death, when you have had time to grieve and plan.

## Financial Assistance Programs

Multiple programs exist to help families cover funeral costs. Many are underutilized because people either do not know about them or assume they will not qualify. Check every option on this list before borrowing:

| Program | Benefit Amount | Who Qualifies | How to Apply |
|---|---|---|---|
| Social Security Lump Sum Death Payment | $255 | Surviving spouse or dependent child of someone who worked and paid Social Security taxes | Call SSA at 1-800-772-1213 or visit your local office |
| VA Burial Benefits | $2,000+ burial allowance; free burial in national cemetery | Veterans who were receiving VA benefits, died in a VA facility, or whose death was service-related. Non-service-connected veterans may receive a lesser amount. | Apply through VA.gov or call 1-800-827-1000. [VA Burials and Memorials](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/) |
| FEMA Funeral Assistance | Up to $9,000 per funeral | Families who incurred funeral costs for a COVID-19-related death | Apply at DisasterAssistance.gov or call 1-844-684-6333 |
| State/County Burial Assistance | Varies by state ($500 - $3,000) | Low-income families, typically those receiving Medicaid or other public assistance. Some states cover full indigent burial costs. | Contact your county Department of Social Services or call [211](https://www.211.org/) |
| Medicaid Burial Assistance | Varies by state | Medicaid recipients in states that offer funeral/burial benefits | Contact your state Medicaid office |
| Union/Fraternal Organization Benefits | $1,000 - $5,000 | Members of unions, fraternal organizations (Elks, Moose Lodge, Knights of Columbus), or professional associations | Contact the organization's member services |
| Church and Community Organizations | Varies | Members or community residents; often flexible on eligibility | Contact your local congregation or community organizations directly |
| Employer Benefits | Varies | Employees of the deceased; some companies offer death benefits, group life insurance, or bereavement assistance | Contact the deceased's employer HR department |

**Start with 211.** Dialing 211 or visiting [211.org](https://www.211.org/) connects you with a local specialist who can identify every assistance program available in your area, including programs specific to your county or city. This single call can surface resources you would never find through a web search.

## Funeral Home Payment Plans

Many funeral homes offer payment plans that allow you to spread the cost over several months. This is often a better option than putting funeral costs on a credit card or taking out a high-interest loan.

When discussing payment plans with a funeral home, ask these specific questions:

- **What is the interest rate?** Some funeral homes offer zero-interest plans for 6 to 12 months. Others use third-party financing companies that charge rates comparable to credit cards (18% to 24% APR) or higher.
- **Is there a down payment required?** Most plans require 30% to 50% upfront, with the remainder financed.
- **What is the total cost if financed versus paid in full?** Calculate the total interest you would pay over the plan period. A $5,000 funeral at 18% APR over 12 months costs $5,500 total — the extra $500 is pure interest.
- **Who is the financing through?** If the funeral home uses a third-party lender, review that lender's terms independently. Some funeral financing companies charge rates of 20% to 30% APR.
- **Are there late fees or penalties?** Understand the consequences of a missed payment before you commit.

A zero-interest payment plan from the funeral home is almost always the best financing option. If the plan carries interest, compare the total cost against other borrowing options before agreeing.

## Crowdfunding for Funeral Costs

GoFundMe and similar platforms have become a common way to cover funeral expenses, and there is no shame in asking for help during a time of loss. Funeral-related campaigns are among the most successful categories on crowdfunding platforms.

**Tips for a successful funeral crowdfunding campaign:**

- **Be specific about costs.** People are more willing to contribute when they can see exactly where the money goes. "We need $5,800 to cover the burial, casket, and cemetery plot" is more compelling than "Please help with funeral costs."
- **Share the person's story.** A brief, heartfelt description of your loved one makes the campaign personal and meaningful.
- **Link to the obituary.** This adds legitimacy and gives people a way to learn more about the person.
- **Share widely.** Post on social media, text it to friends and family, email it to the deceased's contacts, and ask others to share it. Campaigns that get shared beyond the immediate circle raise significantly more.
- **Provide updates.** Thank donors, share how the funeral went, and report the final amount. This builds trust and encourages additional sharing.
- **Start immediately.** Campaigns receive the most donations in the first 48 to 72 hours. Launch as soon as possible, even if the page is simple, and update it later.

The average funeral-related GoFundMe campaign raises between $2,000 and $5,000. Some raise significantly more, particularly when the death was sudden or the deceased was well-known in the community. Even if crowdfunding does not cover the full amount, it can fill the gap after assistance programs and family contributions.

## Personal Loans for Funeral Costs

If assistance programs, payment plans, crowdfunding, and family contributions do not cover the full cost, a personal loan can bridge the remaining gap. This should be a last resort, not a first option — but it is sometimes necessary, and choosing the right type of loan matters.

**When a personal loan makes sense:**
- You have exhausted all free assistance and payment plan options
- You need funds within a few days (faster than life insurance payouts or government programs)
- You can realistically afford the monthly payments alongside your existing obligations
- The amount you need to borrow is specific and manageable (not the entire $8,000 funeral)

**What to choose:**

An [installment loan](/loans/installment) with fixed monthly payments over 6 to 24 months is the best borrowing option for funeral costs. The payment is predictable, the loan has a defined payoff date, and you know the total cost upfront. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to estimate your monthly payment before you commit.

**What to avoid:**

Do not use a payday loan for funeral expenses. The lump-sum repayment structure creates severe risk when you are already under financial stress. A $1,000 payday loan costs $150 to $300 in fees for just two weeks, and if you cannot repay in full, rollover fees compound rapidly. For better alternatives, see our guide on [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives).

Be cautious with funeral home financing through third-party lenders. Some charge APRs of 20% to 30% and bury fees in the paperwork. If a funeral home offers financing, ask for the full terms in writing and compare against a personal loan from a bank, credit union, or online lender before signing.

Credit cards are acceptable for smaller amounts if you can pay off the balance within a few months, but carrying a $5,000 funeral charge at 22% APR for a year adds over $1,100 in interest.

## Life Insurance and Other Assets

Before taking on any debt, check whether the deceased had financial resources that can cover or offset funeral costs:

**Life insurance.** Check for individual policies, employer-provided group life insurance (standard at many companies, often 1x to 2x annual salary), and mortgage-related life insurance. Contact the insurance company directly. Standard payouts take 30 to 60 days, but some insurers offer expedited payment or an advance specifically for funeral expenses if you provide a death certificate and proof of funeral costs. Ask explicitly.

**Bank accounts with payable-on-death (POD) designations.** If the deceased named a beneficiary on their bank account, that person can access the funds immediately by presenting a death certificate at the bank. These funds bypass probate entirely.

**Employer benefits.** Contact the deceased's employer HR department. Beyond group life insurance, some employers offer a death benefit payment, unused vacation/PTO payout, or final paycheck that can help cover immediate expenses.

**Small estate affidavit.** In many states, if the deceased's total assets are below a certain threshold (often $25,000 to $75,000, depending on the state), heirs can access bank accounts and other assets using a small estate affidavit — a simple legal document — without going through probate. This process typically takes a few days to two weeks and can free up funds much faster than formal estate proceedings.

**Veterans benefits.** If the deceased was a veteran, the VA provides burial allowances and may cover a burial plot in a national cemetery at no cost. Benefits vary based on service-connected disability status and circumstances of death. Visit [VA Burials and Memorials](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/) or call 1-800-827-1000.

## Planning Ahead

If this guide reached you before you are facing an immediate need, planning ahead is the single most effective way to protect your family from funeral cost stress.

**Pre-need funeral plans.** Many funeral homes allow you to pre-plan and pre-pay for funeral arrangements at today's prices, locking in costs before inflation increases them. Payments can be made in installments over several years. If you move, many plans are transferable to a different funeral home. Ensure the plan is held in an irrevocable trust or insurance-funded product so the funds are protected.

**Final expense insurance.** Also called burial insurance, these are small whole life insurance policies ($5,000 to $25,000) designed specifically to cover funeral and burial costs. Premiums range from $30 to $70 per month depending on age and health, and most policies have simplified underwriting — meaning you do not need a medical exam. The death benefit is paid to your beneficiary, who can use it for funeral costs or anything else.

**Have the conversation.** The most important thing you can do is tell your family your wishes. Do you want burial or cremation? A large service or a small one? A traditional funeral or a celebration of life? When families know what the deceased wanted, they spend less on things the person would not have cared about and more on what mattered to them.

## Compare Loan Options

If you need to borrow to cover funeral expenses after exploring assistance programs and other resources, comparing multiple lenders ensures you get the best rate and terms available to you. A few percentage points in APR can mean hundreds of dollars in savings over the life of the loan.
