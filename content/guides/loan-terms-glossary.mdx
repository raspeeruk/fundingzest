faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between principal and interest?"
    answer: "Principal is the original amount you borrow. Interest is the cost the lender charges you for borrowing that money, calculated as a percentage of the principal. When you make a loan payment, part goes to reduce the principal and part goes to pay interest."
  - question: "What does APR stand for?"
    answer: "APR stands for Annual Percentage Rate. It represents the total yearly cost of borrowing, including interest and certain fees, expressed as a percentage. APR is the best way to compare the true cost of different loan offers because it accounts for both the interest rate and fees."
  - question: "What is collateral?"
    answer: "Collateral is an asset (like a car, house, or savings account) that you pledge to a lender to secure a loan. If you fail to repay the loan, the lender can seize and sell the collateral to recover their money. Loans with collateral (secured loans) typically have lower interest rates than unsecured loans."
  - question: "What does it mean to default on a loan?"
    answer: "Default means you have failed to meet the terms of your loan agreement, usually by missing multiple payments. Default triggers serious consequences: the full balance may become due immediately, the account is reported to credit bureaus, the debt may be sent to collections, and the lender may take legal action."

## How to Use This Glossary

This glossary is a reference guide to the most common loan and lending terms you will encounter when borrowing money. Terms are listed alphabetically. Where a deeper explanation exists on FundingZest, we have linked to the relevant guide.

Bookmark this page. When you encounter an unfamiliar term on a loan disclosure, in a lender's marketing materials, or in one of our guides, come back here for a clear, plain-language definition.

### A

**ACH (Automated Clearing House)** — An electronic network used to process financial transactions in the United States, including direct deposits and automatic bill payments. Most online lenders use ACH to deposit loan funds into your bank account and to withdraw your monthly payments. ACH transfers typically take one to three business days.

**Amortization** — The process of repaying a loan through a series of equal, scheduled payments over a fixed period. Each payment is split between interest and principal. Early payments are mostly interest; later payments are mostly principal. By the end of the term, the balance reaches zero. See our full guide on [understanding amortization](/guides/understanding-amortization).

**Annual Fee** — A yearly charge some lenders or credit card issuers assess for maintaining the account. Annual fees are separate from interest charges and may or may not be included in the APR calculation depending on the product type. Most personal installment loans do not have annual fees.

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** — The total annual cost of borrowing, expressed as a percentage. APR includes the interest rate plus certain mandatory fees (such as origination fees), giving you a standardized way to compare the cost of different loans. Federal law requires all lenders to disclose the APR before you sign. See [APR vs interest rate](/guides/apr-vs-interest-rate) and [understanding APR on small-dollar loans](/guides/understanding-apr-small-dollar-loans).

### B

**Balance** — The amount of money you currently owe on a loan or credit account. For installment loans, the balance starts at the original loan amount and decreases with each payment. For credit cards and lines of credit, the balance fluctuates based on purchases, payments, and interest charges.

**Bankruptcy** — A legal process that provides individuals or businesses relief from debts they cannot repay. Chapter 7 bankruptcy may discharge (eliminate) certain debts. Chapter 13 bankruptcy reorganizes debts into a court-supervised repayment plan. Bankruptcy remains on your credit report for seven to ten years and makes it significantly harder to borrow in the near term.

**Borrower** — The person or entity that receives money from a lender under the terms of a loan agreement. As the borrower, you are legally obligated to repay the principal plus interest and fees according to the schedule outlined in the agreement.

### C

**Charge-Off** — A declaration by a lender that a debt is unlikely to be collected, typically after 180 days of non-payment. A charge-off does not mean you no longer owe the money — the lender may sell the debt to a collection agency, and it remains on your credit report for seven years. Charge-offs severely damage your credit score.

**Collateral** — An asset you pledge to a lender to secure a loan. If you fail to repay, the lender can seize and sell the collateral to recover their money. Common forms of collateral include vehicles (auto loans), real estate (mortgages), and savings accounts. Loans backed by collateral are called secured loans. See [secured vs unsecured loans](/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-loans).

**Collection Agency** — A company that specializes in recovering unpaid debts. When you default on a loan, the original lender may sell or assign the debt to a collection agency. The agency then contacts you to collect payment. Collection accounts appear on your credit report and can significantly lower your score. See [how collections affect credit](/guides/how-collections-affect-credit).

**Consolidation** — The process of combining multiple debts into a single new loan, ideally with a lower APR or more manageable monthly payment. Debt consolidation simplifies your finances by replacing several payments with one. It saves money only if the new loan has a lower rate than your existing debts. See [is debt consolidation right for you](/guides/is-debt-consolidation-right-for-you).

**Co-Signer** — A person who agrees to be legally responsible for repaying a loan if the primary borrower fails to pay. A co-signer with strong credit can help a borrower with limited or poor credit qualify for a loan or obtain better terms. However, the co-signer's credit is affected by the loan — late payments hurt both parties.

**Credit Bureau** — A company that collects and maintains consumer credit information, then sells credit reports to lenders and other authorized parties. The three major credit bureaus in the United States are **Equifax**, **Experian**, and **TransUnion**. Your credit report from each bureau may differ slightly because not all lenders report to all three.

**Credit Check (Hard/Soft)** — A credit check is a review of your credit report. A **soft inquiry** (soft pull) does not affect your credit score and is used for pre-qualification, background checks, and personal credit monitoring. A **hard inquiry** (hard pull) can temporarily lower your credit score by a few points and occurs when you formally apply for credit. See [soft vs hard credit inquiries](/guides/soft-vs-hard-credit-inquiries).

**Credit-Builder Loan** — A small loan designed specifically to help borrowers build or improve their credit history. With a credit-builder loan, the lender holds the borrowed funds in a savings account while you make monthly payments. Once the loan is fully repaid, you receive the funds. Your on-time payments are reported to credit bureaus, building your credit history. See [credit-builder loans](/guides/credit-builder-loans).

**Credit Report** — A detailed record of your credit history, maintained by each of the three major credit bureaus. It includes your accounts, payment history, balances, credit inquiries, and public records (bankruptcies, liens). Lenders use your credit report to evaluate your creditworthiness. You can request a free copy annually at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). See [how to read your credit report](/guides/how-to-read-credit-report).

**Credit Score** — A three-digit number (typically 300 to 850) that summarizes your creditworthiness based on the information in your credit report. Higher scores indicate lower risk to lenders and qualify you for better loan terms and lower APRs. The two most common scoring models are FICO and VantageScore. See [what is a good credit score](/guides/what-is-good-credit-score).

**Credit Utilization** — The percentage of your available revolving credit that you are currently using. It is calculated by dividing your total revolving balances by your total revolving credit limits. Credit utilization is one of the most influential factors in your credit score. Keeping utilization below 30% is generally recommended; below 10% is ideal.

**Creditor** — Any person or entity to whom you owe money. Your lender is your creditor for the duration of your loan. If the debt is sold, the new owner becomes the creditor. The term is used broadly in legal and financial contexts to describe anyone with a right to collect payment from you.

### D

**Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)** — A measure of how much of your gross monthly income goes toward debt payments. DTI is calculated by dividing your total monthly debt obligations by your gross monthly income. Most lenders prefer a DTI of 40% or below. A high DTI may result in a loan denial or less favorable terms. See [understanding debt-to-income ratio](/guides/understanding-debt-to-income-ratio).

<Callout type="warning" title="Know What Default Means">
Defaulting on a loan triggers severe consequences: the full balance may become due immediately, your credit score takes a major hit, and the debt may be sent to collections or result in legal action. Always contact your lender **before** missing payments to discuss hardship options.
</Callout>

**Default** — Failure to meet the legal obligations of a loan agreement, most commonly by missing multiple consecutive payments. Default triggers serious consequences: the lender may demand the full remaining balance immediately (acceleration), report the default to credit bureaus, send the debt to collections, or pursue legal action. See [what happens when you default](/guides/what-happens-when-you-default).

**Delinquency** — The state of being past due on a payment. Delinquency typically begins the day after a payment is missed and progresses through stages (30 days late, 60 days late, 90 days late). Lenders report delinquency to credit bureaus at 30-day intervals. Delinquency that continues long enough leads to default.

**Direct Deposit** — The electronic transfer of funds directly into a bank account. In the context of lending, lenders use direct deposit (typically via ACH) to send loan proceeds to your checking account. Many lenders require that you have direct deposit of your income as a verification of regular earnings.

**Disbursement** — The release of loan funds from the lender to the borrower. Disbursement typically occurs after you sign the loan agreement and complete any final verification steps. For online personal loans, disbursement usually happens via ACH transfer within one to three business days of approval.

### E

**Earned Wage Access** — A financial service that allows employees to access a portion of their already-earned wages before their scheduled payday. Unlike payday loans, earned wage access is tied to hours already worked and typically charges a small fee or no fee rather than a high interest rate. Some employers offer this benefit directly; third-party apps also provide it.

### F

**FDCPA (Fair Debt Collection Practices Act)** — A federal law that regulates how third-party debt collectors can contact you and what they can say. The FDCPA prohibits harassment, false statements, and unfair practices. It gives you the right to request written verification of a debt and to tell a collector to stop contacting you. It applies to third-party collectors, not original creditors.

**FICO Score** — A credit score created by the Fair Isaac Corporation, used by approximately 90% of top lenders in the United States. FICO scores range from 300 to 850 and are calculated from five categories: payment history (35%), amounts owed (30%), length of credit history (15%), new credit (10%), and credit mix (10%). Different FICO score versions exist for different lending purposes.

**Finance Charge** — The total dollar cost of borrowing, including all interest and certain mandatory fees over the life of the loan. The finance charge tells you exactly how much a loan costs in real dollars. Lenders are required to disclose it under the Truth in Lending Act. See [what is a finance charge](/guides/what-is-finance-charge).

**Fixed Rate** — An interest rate that remains the same for the entire term of the loan. With a fixed-rate loan, your monthly payment never changes, making it easy to budget. Most personal installment loans, auto loans, and conventional mortgages offer fixed rates. See [fixed vs variable rate loans](/guides/fixed-vs-variable-rate-loans).

**Forbearance** — A temporary agreement between a borrower and lender to reduce or suspend loan payments for a limited period, typically during financial hardship. Interest usually continues to accrue during forbearance, increasing the total cost of the loan. Forbearance is not forgiveness — the missed or reduced payments must eventually be repaid.

### G

**Garnishment** — A legal process by which a court orders a portion of your wages, bank account funds, or other assets to be withheld and sent directly to a creditor to satisfy a debt. Wage garnishment can only occur after a court judgment (except for certain federal debts like student loans and taxes). Federal law limits garnishment to 25% of disposable earnings in most cases.

**Grace Period** — A period of time after a payment due date during which you can make the payment without incurring a late fee or penalty. Not all loans have grace periods — check your loan agreement. For credit cards, the grace period is the time between the end of a billing cycle and the payment due date, during which no interest is charged if you pay the full statement balance.

**Guarantor** — Similar to a co-signer, a guarantor is a person who agrees to repay a loan if the primary borrower defaults. The key difference is that a guarantor's obligation is typically secondary — the lender must first attempt to collect from the borrower before pursuing the guarantor. In practice, the terms co-signer and guarantor are often used interchangeably.

### I

**Installment Loan** — A loan that is repaid in a series of equal, scheduled payments (installments) over a fixed period. Each payment includes a portion of principal and interest. Personal loans, auto loans, mortgages, and student loans are all types of installment loans. See [how installment loans work](/guides/how-installment-loans-work).

**Interest Rate** — The percentage a lender charges on the outstanding loan balance over time, expressed as an annual figure. The interest rate represents the base cost of borrowing before any additional fees. It is one component of the APR — the APR is typically higher than the interest rate because it also includes certain fees.

### L

**Late Fee** — A charge imposed by a lender when you fail to make a payment by the due date (or by the end of the grace period, if one exists). Late fees are typically a flat dollar amount ($15 to $39) or a percentage of the missed payment (commonly 5%). Late fees are not included in the finance charge or APR because they are conditional.

**Lender** — The institution or individual that provides money to a borrower under the terms of a loan agreement. Lenders include banks, credit unions, online lending platforms, and private individuals. The lender earns a return on the loan through interest and fees.

**Lien** — A legal claim on an asset that serves as security for a debt. If you take out an auto loan, the lender places a lien on your vehicle. You cannot sell the vehicle free and clear until the lien is released — which happens when the loan is fully repaid. Liens can also be placed on property for unpaid taxes or court judgments.

**Line of Credit** — A flexible borrowing arrangement where a lender approves you for a maximum credit limit, and you can draw funds as needed up to that limit. You pay interest only on the amount you have drawn, not the full limit. As you repay, the available credit replenishes. Lines of credit are revolving, not amortized. See [line of credit vs personal loan](/guides/line-of-credit-vs-personal-loan).

### O

**Origination Fee** — A one-time fee charged by some lenders for processing and funding a loan. Origination fees typically range from 1% to 8% of the loan amount and are either deducted from the loan proceeds at disbursement or added to the loan balance. The origination fee is included in the APR calculation. See [origination fees explained](/guides/origination-fees-explained).

### P

**Payday Loan** — A short-term, small-dollar loan (typically $100 to $1,000) that is due in full on the borrower's next payday, usually within two to four weeks. Payday loans charge a flat fee per amount borrowed (commonly $10 to $30 per $100), which translates to very high APRs (200% to 780%+). They do not amortize — the full balance plus fees is due in a single lump-sum payment. See [how payday loans work](/guides/how-payday-loans-work).

**Prepayment Penalty** — A fee some lenders charge if you pay off your loan before the scheduled end of the term. Prepayment penalties compensate the lender for the interest they lose when you pay early. Most reputable online lenders do not charge prepayment penalties, but always verify this before signing. See [prepayment penalties explained](/guides/prepayment-penalties-explained).

**Principal** — The original amount of money you borrow, before any interest or fees are added. As you make loan payments, a portion of each payment reduces the principal. The remaining principal balance is the amount on which interest is calculated. When the principal reaches zero, the loan is fully repaid.

### R

**Refinancing** — The process of replacing an existing loan with a new loan, typically to obtain a lower interest rate, reduce the monthly payment, or change the loan term. Refinancing makes financial sense when the new loan's total cost is lower than what you would pay on the existing loan. Consider closing costs and fees when evaluating whether refinancing saves money.

**Repossession** — The legal seizure of collateral by a lender when a borrower defaults on a secured loan. The most common example is vehicle repossession for defaulted auto loans. In most states, lenders can repossess a vehicle without a court order once the borrower is in default. The lender typically sells the repossessed asset and applies the proceeds to the outstanding balance.

<StatHighlight value="200-780%+" label="effective APR range on payday loans -- rollovers can make total cost exceed the original amount borrowed" icon="warning" variant="red" />

**Rollover** — The practice of extending a payday loan's due date by paying an additional fee while the principal remains unpaid. Rollovers add a new finance charge each cycle without reducing the original balance, which can quickly make the total cost exceed the amount borrowed. Many states restrict or prohibit rollovers. See [how payday loans work](/guides/how-payday-loans-work).

### S

**Secured Loan** — A loan backed by collateral — an asset the lender can seize if you default. Auto loans (secured by the vehicle), mortgages (secured by the property), and title loans (secured by the vehicle title) are common examples. Secured loans generally offer lower APRs than unsecured loans because the collateral reduces the lender's risk. See [secured vs unsecured loans](/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-loans).

### T

**Term** — The length of time you have to repay a loan, usually expressed in months. A 12-month term means you make 12 monthly payments. Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less total interest. Longer terms mean lower monthly payments but more total interest. Choosing the right term is one of the most important decisions when taking out a loan.

**Title Loan** — A short-term, secured loan where the borrower's vehicle title is used as collateral. Title loans typically range from $100 to $5,500 and carry very high APRs (often 100% to 300%+). If you fail to repay, the lender can repossess your vehicle. Title loans are considered high-risk borrowing products. See [title loans: how they work](/guides/title-loans-how-they-work).

**Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** — A federal law enacted in 1968 that requires lenders to provide standardized disclosures about loan costs and terms before the borrower signs the agreement. TILA mandates disclosure of the APR, finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule. Its purpose is to help consumers compare the cost of credit across different lenders and products. The law is enforced by the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/).

### U

**Underwriting** — The process by which a lender evaluates a loan application to determine whether to approve it and on what terms. Underwriting involves reviewing the borrower's credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, employment, and other risk factors. Automated underwriting systems can produce decisions in minutes, while manual underwriting may take several days.

**Unsecured Loan** — A loan that is not backed by any collateral. The lender relies solely on the borrower's creditworthiness and promise to repay. Most personal installment loans and credit cards are unsecured. Because the lender takes on more risk, unsecured loans typically carry higher APRs than secured loans. See [secured vs unsecured loans](/guides/secured-vs-unsecured-loans).

**Usury** — The practice of charging excessive or illegally high interest rates on loans. Usury laws vary by state and set maximum interest rates or fees that lenders can charge. Some states have strict usury caps (such as 36% APR), while others have higher limits or exemptions for certain loan types. See [state usury laws explained](/guides/state-usury-laws-explained).

### V

**Variable Rate** — An interest rate that can change over the life of the loan, typically based on a benchmark index (such as the Prime Rate). When the index rises, your rate and payment increase; when it falls, they decrease. Variable-rate loans may start with lower rates than fixed-rate loans but carry the risk of future increases. Most personal installment loans are fixed-rate, not variable. See [fixed vs variable rate loans](/guides/fixed-vs-variable-rate-loans).

**VantageScore** — A credit scoring model developed jointly by Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion as an alternative to FICO. VantageScore uses the same 300 to 850 range and considers similar factors (payment history, credit utilization, age of accounts, etc.), but weighs them differently. Some lenders use VantageScore instead of or in addition to FICO. The score you see on free credit monitoring services is often a VantageScore.

<Callout type="tip" title="Always Compare APR, Not Just Interest Rate">
When evaluating any loan, focus on the **APR** (Annual Percentage Rate), not the interest rate alone. The APR includes mandatory fees and gives you the true annual cost of borrowing. Federal law requires all lenders to disclose it.
