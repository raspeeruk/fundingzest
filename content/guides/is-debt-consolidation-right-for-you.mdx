faqs:
  - question: "What exactly is debt consolidation?"
    answer: "Debt consolidation is the process of combining multiple debts — such as credit cards, medical bills, payday loans, or personal loans — into a single loan with one monthly payment. The goal is to secure a lower interest rate, reduce your monthly payment, or both. You use the new loan to pay off your existing debts, then repay the single consolidated loan over a fixed term."
  - question: "Will debt consolidation hurt my credit score?"
    answer: "In the short term, applying for a consolidation loan triggers a hard inquiry that may lower your score by 5-10 points. However, consolidation often improves your credit over time by reducing your credit utilization ratio (if you pay off credit cards), replacing multiple accounts with one structured payment, and making on-time payments easier to manage. The net effect is typically positive within 2-3 months."
  - question: "What is the difference between debt consolidation and debt settlement?"
    answer: "Debt consolidation means you repay 100% of what you owe, but at a lower interest rate or with a simpler payment structure. Debt settlement means you negotiate to pay less than the full amount owed, typically 40-60 cents on the dollar. Settlement severely damages your credit score, may trigger tax liability on forgiven debt, and often involves stopping payments to creditors for months — which adds late fees and collection activity."
  - question: "Is there a minimum amount of debt needed for consolidation?"
    answer: "There is no strict minimum, but consolidation typically makes financial sense when you have at least $2,000 to $3,000 in total debt across multiple accounts. Below that amount, the origination fees and effort of a new loan may not produce meaningful savings. For smaller debts, a balance transfer card with a 0% introductory APR or simply paying down balances aggressively may be more effective."
  - question: "Can I consolidate payday loans?"
    answer: "Yes, and payday loans are among the best candidates for consolidation because of their extremely high APRs (typically 300-700%). Replacing multiple payday loan obligations with a single installment loan — even one at 36% to 99% APR — can save hundreds or thousands of dollars. The key challenge is qualifying: payday loan borrowers often have lower credit scores, which limits consolidation options. FundingZest works with lenders who consider borrowers across the credit spectrum."

## What Is Debt Consolidation?

Debt consolidation means combining multiple debts into a single loan with one monthly payment. Instead of tracking four credit card minimums, two medical bills, and a personal loan — each with different due dates, interest rates, and payment amounts — you take out one new loan, use it to pay off all of those balances, and then repay the single consolidated loan.

The goal is straightforward: **lower your total interest cost, simplify your payments, or both.**

Consolidation is not debt elimination. You still owe the same total principal. What changes is the structure — ideally, a lower interest rate, a fixed repayment schedule, and a clear payoff date.

### Three Main Methods

There are several ways to consolidate debt, each suited to different situations:

1. **Personal consolidation loan** — A fixed-rate installment loan from a bank, credit union, or online lender used to pay off existing debts
2. **Balance transfer credit card** — A new credit card with a 0% introductory APR period (typically 12-21 months), onto which you transfer existing credit card balances
3. **Debt management plan (DMP)** — A structured repayment program administered by a nonprofit credit counseling agency that negotiates lower interest rates with your creditors

Less common methods include home equity loans (HELOCs), 401(k) loans, and borrowing from family — each with significant trade-offs discussed below.

## How Debt Consolidation Works: Step by Step

Here is how the process typically works with a personal consolidation loan:

**Step 1: Add up your debts.** List every balance, interest rate, minimum payment, and remaining term.

**Step 2: Check your credit.** Your credit score determines which consolidation products you qualify for and at what rate. You can [check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free) through several services.

**Step 3: Get pre-qualified offers.** Apply with multiple lenders to see estimated rates and terms. Pre-qualification uses a soft credit pull that does not affect your score. [Submit one application through FundingZest](/apply) to see offers from multiple lenders.

**Step 4: Compare offers against your current debts.** Calculate whether the new loan's total cost is less than the combined total cost of your existing debts. This is the critical step — if the math does not work, consolidation does not make sense.

**Step 5: Accept the best offer and pay off existing debts.** Some lenders send funds directly to your creditors; others deposit the money into your bank account for you to distribute.

**Step 6: Make consistent payments on the new loan.** Set up autopay to avoid missed payments. Do not accumulate new debt on the accounts you just paid off.

### Example With Real Numbers

Sarah has three debts:

| Debt | Balance | APR | Minimum Payment | Monthly Interest |
|------|---------|-----|-----------------|------------------|
| Credit Card A | $3,200 | 24.99% | $96 | $67 |
| Credit Card B | $1,800 | 19.99% | $54 | $30 |
| Medical bill (on payment plan) | $2,000 | 0% | $167 | $0 |
| **Total** | **$7,000** | — | **$317** | **$97** |

Sarah qualifies for a $7,000 personal loan at 11.5% APR over 36 months. Her new single payment would be $231 per month, and she would pay $1,316 in total interest over three years.

If she continued paying minimums on her credit cards (and maintained the medical payment plan), she would pay approximately $2,400 in interest over roughly 4 years on the cards alone — and the medical bill would be paid off in 12 months regardless.

<StatHighlight value="$1,084" label="in interest savings by consolidating three debts into one loan at 11.5% APR" icon="dollar" variant="green" />

Consolidation also provides a fixed payoff date and one payment instead of three.

However, note that the medical bill already carries 0% interest. Consolidating it into an 11.5% loan actually increases the cost of that particular debt. A smarter approach might be to consolidate only the two credit cards and leave the medical bill on its existing plan.

This is why running the numbers matters more than following a rule of thumb.

## Consolidation Methods Compared

| Method | Best For | Typical APR | Pros | Cons |
|--------|----------|-------------|------|------|
| Personal loan | $2,000-$50,000 in mixed debt | 6%-36% | Fixed rate, fixed term, predictable payments | Origination fee (1%-8%), requires fair to good credit for best rates |
| Balance transfer card | Credit card debt under $10,000 | 0% intro (12-21 months), then 17%-29% | No interest during intro period | Transfer fee (3%-5%), must pay off before intro expires, requires good credit |
| HELOC / Home equity loan | Large debt ($10,000+), homeowners only | 7%-12% | Lowest rates available | Your home is collateral — risk of foreclosure if you default |
| Debt management plan | Borrowers struggling to qualify for loans | Negotiated (often 0%-8%) | No credit score requirement, professional guidance | Monthly fee ($25-$50), takes 3-5 years, may require closing credit accounts |

For most borrowers with fair to good credit and $3,000 to $20,000 in high-interest debt, a **personal consolidation loan** offers the best combination of accessibility, cost savings, and simplicity. For borrowers with good credit and credit card debt specifically, a **balance transfer card** can eliminate interest entirely — if you can pay it off within the promotional window.

## When Consolidation Makes Sense

Debt consolidation is a good strategy when **all of the following are true:**

- Your total interest rate across existing debts is higher than the consolidation loan rate
- You can qualify for a consolidation loan at a meaningfully lower APR
- You have stable income to make the new monthly payment consistently
- You are committed to not running up new balances on paid-off credit cards
- The total cost of the new loan (including fees) is less than the total remaining cost of your current debts

### When Consolidation Does NOT Make Sense

- **Your credit score only qualifies you for a high-rate loan.** If the consolidation loan's APR is higher than your current weighted average rate, you are paying more, not less.
- **You would extend the repayment period significantly.** Stretching $7,000 in debt from 2 years to 5 years might lower your monthly payment but increase total interest paid.
- **You have a spending problem, not just a debt problem.** Consolidation frees up credit card limits. If you use those cards again, you end up with the consolidation loan payment plus new credit card debt — a worse position than where you started.
- **Your debt is small and manageable.** If you owe $1,500 across two cards and can pay it off in 6 months, the origination fee and effort of a new loan may not be worth the modest savings.
- **You are considering a HELOC and your job or income is unstable.** Putting your home at risk to consolidate unsecured debt is rarely worth the lower rate if there is any chance you cannot maintain payments.

## The Math: Is It Actually Cheaper?

This is the most important section of this guide. Consolidation only works if the numbers work. Here is how to calculate it.

### What You Need

For each existing debt, gather:
- Current balance
- APR
- Monthly payment
- Remaining term (or estimated payoff date at current payment)

For the consolidation loan offer, you need:
- APR
- Monthly payment
- Loan term
- Origination fee (if any)
- Total amount repaid over the life of the loan

### Side-by-Side Comparison

| | Current Debts (Combined) | Consolidation Loan |
|---|---|---|
| Total balance | $12,000 | $12,000 |
| Weighted average APR | 22.4% | 13.5% |
| Monthly payment | $480 | $408 |
| Origination fee | $0 | $360 (3%) |
| Repayment term | ~32 months | 36 months |
| Total interest paid | $3,360 | $2,688 |
| Total cost (interest + fees) | **$3,360** | **$3,048** |

In this example, consolidation saves $312 in total cost and reduces the monthly payment by $72. The origination fee eats into some of the savings, but the lower APR more than compensates.

Now change one variable — the consolidation loan term:

| | 36-Month Term | 48-Month Term | 60-Month Term |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monthly payment | $408 | $323 | $273 |
| Total interest paid | $2,688 | $3,504 | $4,380 |
| Total cost (interest + fees) | $3,048 | $3,864 | $4,740 |

The 48-month and 60-month terms have lower monthly payments but cost more than the current debts. Extending the term too far erases the benefit of the lower rate.

**Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to run these numbers with your actual balances and offers.**

## Payday Loan Consolidation

If you are carrying one or more [payday loans](/loans/payday), consolidation is almost always worth pursuing — because the APR gap is enormous.

### The APR Difference

| Loan Type | Typical APR | Cost of $2,000 Over 6 Months |
|-----------|-------------|------------------------------|
| Payday loans (rolled over biweekly) | 391%-521% | $2,340-$3,120 in fees |
| Subprime installment loan | 99%-199% | $530-$1,060 in interest |
| Fair-credit personal loan | 15%-36% | $90-$216 in interest |

<ComparisonRow title="$2,000 Over 6 Months: Payday vs Personal Loan" options={[
  { title: "Payday Loans (Rolled Over)", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "APR", value: "391-521%" }, { label: "Total Fees", value: "$2,340-$3,120" }] },
  { title: "Personal Loan", variant: "green", recommended: true, stats: [{ label: "APR", value: "15-36%" }, { label: "Total Interest", value: "$90-$216" }] }
]} />

Even replacing payday loans with a subprime installment loan at 99% APR saves $1,810 or more over six months. The savings compound because installment loans have a fixed repayment schedule — there are no rollovers, no recurring fees on an unpaid balance, and a guaranteed payoff date.

### How to Consolidate Payday Loans

1. **Stop the cycle first.** If possible, avoid taking new payday loans while pursuing consolidation.
2. **Check your options.** Credit union [Payday Alternative Loans (PALs)](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) offer rates capped at 28% APR. Online installment lenders work with borrowers across the credit spectrum.
3. **Apply through FundingZest.** [Submit one application](/apply) to see offers from multiple lenders — including those that specialize in helping borrowers transition out of payday loan cycles.
4. **Use the loan to pay off all payday obligations.** Ensure each payday lender confirms the balance is paid in full and that any automatic payment authorizations are revoked.
5. **Set up autopay on the consolidation loan.** This prevents missed payments and may qualify you for a rate discount.

## How to Get a Consolidation Loan

### Check Your Credit Score

Your credit score determines your rate. The higher your score, the lower the APR — and the greater the savings from consolidation. If your score is below 580, options are limited but not nonexistent. Between 580 and 669 (fair credit), you will qualify for most online lenders. Above 670 (good credit), you will access the best rates.

[Learn how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free).

### Compare Multiple Offers

Never accept the first offer. Compare at least 3-5 pre-qualified offers from different lender types — banks, credit unions, and online lenders. Read our step-by-step guide on [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers) for a detailed framework.

### What Lenders Look At

- **Credit score:** Primary factor in determining your rate
- **Debt-to-income ratio:** Your total monthly debt payments divided by gross monthly income — most lenders want this below 40%
- **Employment and income stability:** Consistent income reassures lenders you can make payments
- **Existing relationship:** Some banks and credit unions offer rate discounts to existing customers or members

### Documents You Will Need

- Government-issued ID
- Proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements)
- List of debts to consolidate (account numbers, balances, and lender names)
- Proof of residence

<Callout type="warning" title="Beware the Consolidation Trap">
The most common reason debt consolidation fails is borrowers paying off credit cards, then charging them back up. You end up with the consolidation loan **plus** new credit card debt -- a worse position than where you started.
</Callout>

## Avoiding the "Consolidation Trap"

Debt consolidation fails when borrowers treat it as a solution to the underlying problem rather than a financial tool. The most common failure pattern:

1. You consolidate $10,000 in credit card debt into a personal loan
2. Your credit cards now have $10,000 in available credit
3. Over the next 12-18 months, you charge $6,000 on those cards
4. You now owe $10,000 on the consolidation loan **plus** $6,000 in new credit card debt — $16,000 total, up from $10,000

This pattern is so common that researchers at the [National Foundation for Credit Counseling](https://www.nfcc.org/) identify it as the primary reason consolidation fails for many borrowers.

### How to Avoid It

- **Do not close old accounts** (this can hurt your credit utilization ratio), but **do remove them from your wallet and online shopping profiles.** Make it inconvenient to use them.
- **Build an emergency fund** so unexpected expenses go to savings, not credit cards. Even $500 can prevent a relapse. See our guide on [how to build an emergency fund](/guides/how-to-build-emergency-fund).
- **Track your spending.** Use a simple budgeting app or spreadsheet to monitor where your money goes each month.
- **Set up autopay on the consolidation loan** and treat it as a non-negotiable monthly expense.
- **Address the root cause.** If overspending is driven by income gaps, explore ways to increase income. If it is behavioral, consider working with a nonprofit credit counselor through the [NFCC](https://www.nfcc.org/).

The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) and the [FTC's consumer advice on borrowing](https://consumer.ftc.gov/credit-loans-and-debt) offer free resources for managing debt and identifying legitimate consolidation programs.

<Callout type="tip" title="Run the Numbers First">
Use the [loan calculator](/calculator) to compare the **total cost** of your current debts against any consolidation offer. Include origination fees. If the consolidation loan costs more overall, it is not worth it -- no matter how much lower the monthly payment looks.

## Is Consolidation Right for You? A Quick Checklist

Answer these questions honestly:

- **Is your total debt above $2,000?** If not, aggressive repayment may be simpler.
- **Can you qualify for a lower APR than your current weighted average?** If not, consolidation increases your cost.
- **Is the total cost of the consolidation loan (interest + fees) less than your current path?** Run the numbers.
- **Can you afford the new monthly payment without borrowing more?** If the payment stretches your budget to the breaking point, a longer term or smaller loan may be needed.
- **Will you stop using the credit cards you pay off?** If the answer is "probably not," address spending habits before consolidating.

If you answered yes to all five, consolidation is likely a good move. If you answered no to two or more, it may create more problems than it solves.

## Compare Your Consolidation Options

Debt consolidation works when the math works — and when you commit to the plan. Start by seeing what rates and terms you qualify for. FundingZest lets you compare pre-qualified offers from multiple lenders with a single application and no impact to your credit score.
