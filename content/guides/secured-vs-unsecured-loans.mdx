  - question: "What is the main difference between secured and unsecured loans?"
    answer: "The main difference is collateral. Secured loans require you to pledge an asset (car, home, savings account) that the lender can seize if you default. Unsecured loans require no collateral — approval is based on your creditworthiness, income, and ability to repay. Secured loans typically have lower APRs because the lender takes less risk."
  - question: "Which type of loan is easier to get with bad credit?"
    answer: "Secured loans are generally easier to get with bad credit because the collateral reduces the lender's risk. However, you need to own an asset to pledge. If you don't have collateral, unsecured loans for bad credit are available from online lenders, though they come with higher APRs."
  - question: "Can I lose my car or house with a secured loan?"
    answer: "Yes. If you default on a secured loan, the lender has the legal right to seize and sell the collateral to recover the debt. For auto title loans, this means repossession. For home equity loans, this could mean foreclosure. Always ensure you can afford the payments before taking a secured loan."
  - question: "Are payday loans secured or unsecured?"
    answer: "Payday loans are unsecured — they do not require collateral. However, they do typically require access to your bank account for repayment. Despite being unsecured, payday loans have very high APRs (200-780%) because lenders compensate for the higher risk with higher fees."
  - question: "Which type of loan has lower interest rates?"
    answer: "Secured loans almost always have lower interest rates than unsecured loans of the same amount and term. For example, a secured personal loan might have an APR of 5-15%, while an equivalent unsecured loan might be 10-36%. The collateral reduces lender risk, which translates to savings for you."

When you borrow money, the loan will fall into one of two broad categories: secured or unsecured. This single distinction — whether collateral is involved — shapes everything about the loan: the interest rate you pay, the amount you can borrow, the approval requirements, and what happens if you cannot repay. Understanding the difference is essential for making an informed borrowing decision.

This guide breaks down how each type works, compares costs and risks side by side, and helps you determine which option fits your financial situation.

## Secured vs Unsecured Loans: Quick Comparison

Before diving into the details, here is a high-level comparison of the two loan types:

| Feature                | Secured Loan                                    | Unsecured Loan                                  |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Collateral Required**| Yes — asset pledged (car, home, savings, etc.)  | No — based on creditworthiness                  |
| **Typical APR**        | 3%-20%                                          | 6%-36% (up to 780% for payday loans)            |
| **Loan Amounts**       | $1,000-$500,000+                                | $100-$100,000                                   |
| **Risk to Borrower**   | Loss of collateral if you default               | Credit damage, collections, potential lawsuits   |
| **Credit Requirements**| Lower (collateral offsets risk)                  | Higher (lender has no asset to fall back on)     |
| **Approval Speed**     | Slower (collateral appraisal may be required)   | Faster (no asset verification needed)            |
| **Best For**           | Large purchases, borrowers with assets, lower rates | Quick funding, no-asset borrowers, flexibility |

Both types are legitimate borrowing tools. Neither is inherently better — the right choice depends entirely on your circumstances.

## How Secured Loans Work

A secured loan is any loan that requires you to pledge an asset as **collateral**. Collateral is something of value that the lender can legally seize and sell if you fail to repay the loan. The collateral acts as a safety net for the lender: if you stop making payments, they are not left empty-handed.

### The Collateral and Lien Process

When you take out a secured loan, the lender places a **lien** on the collateral. A lien is a legal claim that gives the lender rights to the asset until the debt is fully repaid. You still own and can use the asset (you drive the car, live in the house), but you cannot sell it without satisfying the lien first.

For example, when you finance a car, the lender holds the vehicle title until you pay off the loan. When you take out a mortgage, the lender records a lien against your property with the county recorder's office.

### What Happens If You Default

If you miss payments and default on a secured loan, the lender can initiate a process to seize the collateral:

- **Auto loans and title loans:** The lender can repossess your vehicle, often without a court order in many states.
- **Mortgages and home equity loans:** The lender can begin foreclosure proceedings to sell your home.
- **Savings-secured loans:** The lender can withdraw the pledged funds from your savings account or CD.

After seizing and selling the collateral, if the sale does not cover the full balance owed (a "deficiency"), the lender may still pursue you for the remaining amount in some states.

### Common Examples of Secured Loans

- **Auto loans** — The vehicle you are purchasing serves as collateral.
- **Mortgages** — The home you are buying or refinancing secures the loan.
- **Auto title loans** — You borrow against the equity in a vehicle you already own. Learn more in our guide on [title loans](/guides/title-loans-how-they-work).
- **Secured personal loans** — Your savings account, CD, or other deposit serves as collateral.
- **Home equity loans and HELOCs** — Your home equity serves as collateral for a second loan.
- **Secured credit cards** — You place a cash deposit that serves as your credit limit (technically secured credit, not a loan).

Because the lender has recourse through the collateral, secured loans generally have **lower interest rates**, **higher borrowing limits**, and **more lenient credit requirements** than their unsecured counterparts.

## How Unsecured Loans Work

An unsecured loan does not require any collateral. The lender's decision to approve you — and the rate they charge — is based entirely on your **creditworthiness**: your credit score, credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, and employment stability.

Without collateral as a backstop, the lender takes on more risk. If you default, they cannot simply seize an asset. Instead, they must pursue repayment through collections agencies, credit reporting, or legal action (lawsuits and wage garnishment). This higher risk is reflected in the pricing: unsecured loans almost always carry higher APRs than comparable secured loans.

### Common Examples of Unsecured Loans

- **Personal loans** — The most common unsecured loan product. Available from banks, credit unions, and online lenders for amounts typically ranging from $1,000 to $50,000 at APRs of 6-36%.
- **Payday loans** — Small, short-term unsecured loans (typically $100-$1,000) with extremely high APRs. See our [payday loans page](/loans/payday) for details.
- **Student loans** — Both federal and most private student loans are unsecured.
- **Credit cards** — Revolving unsecured credit with variable APRs, typically 18-29%.
- **Personal lines of credit** — Flexible unsecured borrowing with a set credit limit.

Unsecured loans are the more common type for everyday borrowing. Most personal loans, credit cards, and short-term loans fall into this category.

## Common Types of Each

Here is a more detailed breakdown of the specific loan products in each category:

### Secured Loan Types

| Loan Type                 | Collateral             | Typical APR     | Typical Amount        | Typical Term        |
|---------------------------|------------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Mortgage                  | Home                   | 5%-8%           | $100,000-$500,000+    | 15-30 years         |
| Auto Loan                 | Vehicle                | 4%-13%          | $5,000-$75,000        | 36-84 months        |
| Auto Title Loan           | Vehicle (owned)        | 25%-300%        | $100-$10,000          | 15-30 days          |
| Secured Personal Loan     | Savings/CD             | 5%-15%          | $500-$50,000          | 12-60 months        |
| Home Equity Loan          | Home equity            | 6%-12%          | $10,000-$250,000      | 5-30 years          |
| CD-Secured Loan           | Certificate of Deposit | 2%-5% above CD rate | Up to CD value    | 12-60 months        |

### Unsecured Loan Types

| Loan Type                 | Collateral | Typical APR     | Typical Amount        | Typical Term        |
|---------------------------|------------|-----------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
| Personal Loan             | None       | 6%-36%          | $1,000-$50,000        | 12-84 months        |
| Payday Loan               | None       | 200%-780%       | $100-$1,000           | 7-30 days           |
| Federal Student Loan      | None       | 5%-9%           | $5,500-$20,500/year   | 10-25 years         |
| Private Student Loan      | None       | 4%-16%          | Up to cost of attendance | 5-20 years       |
| Credit Card               | None       | 18%-29%         | $500-$30,000          | Revolving            |
| Personal Line of Credit   | None       | 8%-24%          | $1,000-$100,000       | Revolving            |

Note that auto title loans appear in the secured column despite often being marketed alongside payday loans. The key difference is that title loans use your vehicle as collateral — if you default, the lender can take your car.

## Cost Comparison

The cost difference between secured and unsecured loans is significant and directly tied to the lender's risk exposure. Here is how typical APRs compare across different credit tiers:

### Secured Personal Loan vs Unsecured Personal Loan APR by Credit Score

| Credit Score Range  | Credit Tier     | Secured Personal Loan APR | Unsecured Personal Loan APR | Difference |
|---------------------|-----------------|---------------------------|-----------------------------|------------|
| 720-850             | Excellent       | 5%-8%                     | 6%-12%                      | 1-4%       |
| 680-719             | Good            | 7%-11%                    | 10%-18%                     | 3-7%       |
| 640-679             | Fair            | 9%-14%                    | 16%-25%                     | 7-11%      |
| 580-639             | Poor            | 11%-17%                   | 22%-32%                     | 11-15%     |
| Below 580           | Very Poor       | 14%-20%                   | 28%-36% (if approved)       | 14-16%     |

The pattern is clear: the lower your credit score, the bigger the gap between secured and unsecured rates. For borrowers with poor credit, using collateral can save hundreds or thousands of dollars in interest over the life of a loan.

### What This Looks Like in Dollars

Consider a $5,000 loan with a 36-month term:

| Scenario                           | APR  | Monthly Payment | Total Interest | Total Repaid |
|------------------------------------|------|-----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Secured loan, good credit          | 8%   | $156.68         | $640.48        | $5,640.48    |
| Unsecured loan, good credit        | 14%  | $170.93         | $1,153.48      | $6,153.48    |
| Secured loan, poor credit          | 15%  | $173.33         | $1,239.88      | $6,239.88    |
| Unsecured loan, poor credit        | 30%  | $207.53         | $2,471.08      | $7,471.08    |

<ComparisonRow title="$5,000 Loan with Poor Credit: Secured vs Unsecured" options={[

For a borrower with poor credit, choosing a secured loan over an unsecured one saves over **$1,200** in interest on a $5,000 loan. That is a meaningful difference.

## Risks of Each Type

Neither secured nor unsecured loans are risk-free. Understanding the specific risks of each helps you make a more informed decision.

### Risks of Secured Loans

<Callout type="cost" title="Default Risk: You Can Lose Your Asset">
If you default on a secured loan, the lender can seize your car, home, or savings. Repossession and foreclosure are reported to credit bureaus and can devastate your credit score for years.
</Callout>

**Loss of collateral is the primary risk.** If you cannot make payments, the lender can seize your pledged asset. This means:

- Losing your car (auto loan or title loan default)
- Losing your home (mortgage or home equity loan default)
- Losing your savings (savings-secured loan default)

The consequences extend beyond the asset itself. Repossession and foreclosure are reported to credit bureaus and devastate your credit score for years. If the sale of the collateral does not cover your full balance, you may still owe the deficiency.

**Other risks include:**

- **Slower process** — Collateral appraisals and title checks take time, which can delay funding.
- **Being "underwater"** — If the collateral decreases in value (a car depreciating, a home losing value), you may owe more than the asset is worth.
- **Restricted asset use** — You typically cannot sell or significantly modify the collateral without the lender's permission.

### Risks of Unsecured Loans

**Higher interest costs are the primary risk.** Without collateral, you pay more for borrowing, which increases the total cost of the loan and the risk of payment strain.

**If you default on an unsecured loan:**

- Your credit score will drop significantly (late payments, charge-offs, collections all appear on your report).
- The lender may sell the debt to a collections agency, which will pursue repayment aggressively.
- The lender or collector may file a lawsuit. If they obtain a judgment, they can potentially garnish wages or place liens on your assets — depending on your state's laws.
- The default remains on your credit report for up to seven years.

While you will not lose a specific pledged asset, the financial and credit consequences of defaulting on an unsecured loan are still serious. The [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/) provides resources on understanding your credit report and disputing errors.

## When to Choose a Secured Loan

A secured loan may be the better option when:

- **You want the lowest possible interest rate.** If minimizing interest expense is a priority, pledging collateral can knock several percentage points off your APR. This is especially impactful on larger, longer-term loans.
- **You have bad credit but own assets.** If your credit score makes unsecured lending expensive or inaccessible, a secured loan using your car, savings, or other assets can open the door to affordable borrowing. See our [bad-credit loan options](/loans/bad-credit).
- **You are borrowing a large amount.** For loan amounts above $25,000-$50,000, secured loans are often the only practical option. Lenders are unlikely to extend very large unsecured loans to most consumers.
- **You are comfortable with the collateral risk.** This means you have high confidence in your ability to repay and understand exactly what you stand to lose if circumstances change.
- **You are buying the asset the loan finances.** Auto loans and mortgages naturally use the purchased asset as collateral. In these cases, you are not risking an existing asset — you are financing a new one.

## When to Choose an Unsecured Loan

An unsecured loan may be the better option when:

- **You do not want to risk losing an asset.** If the thought of potentially losing your car or savings keeps you up at night, an unsecured loan removes that specific risk.
- **You do not own significant assets to pledge.** If you are a renter without a car or substantial savings, secured loans are simply not available to you. Unsecured [installment loans](/loans/installment) and personal loans are the practical option.
- **You have good to excellent credit.** Borrowers with credit scores above 700 can often qualify for unsecured personal loan rates in the 6-12% range, which is competitive enough that the savings from a secured loan may not justify the collateral risk.
- **You need money quickly.** Unsecured loans, especially from online lenders, can be approved and funded within 1-3 business days. Secured loans may require appraisals, title checks, and other documentation that slows the process.
- **You are borrowing a smaller amount.** For loans under $5,000, the absolute dollar difference in interest between secured and unsecured rates is often small. The convenience and simplicity of unsecured borrowing may outweigh the modest savings.

## Special Case: Payday Loans

[Payday loans](/loans/payday) deserve special attention in this discussion. They are technically unsecured — no collateral is required — but they occupy a unique and often harmful niche in the lending market.

A typical payday loan works like this: you borrow $100-$1,000 and agree to repay the full amount plus a flat fee (usually $10-$30 per $100 borrowed) on your next payday, typically within two weeks. You provide the lender with a post-dated check or authorize an ACH debit from your bank account.

While payday loans require no collateral in the traditional sense, the lender's direct access to your bank account creates a similar dynamic. If you cannot repay, the lender withdraws the amount directly, which can trigger overdraft fees and cascade into further financial problems.

<StatHighlight value="391%" label="APR on a typical payday loan — far more expensive than any secured or unsecured personal loan" icon="warning" variant="red" />

**The cost is staggering.** A $15 fee per $100 borrowed on a two-week payday loan translates to an APR of approximately **391%**. This makes payday loans one of the most expensive borrowing methods available — far more expensive than either secured or unsecured personal loans.

<Callout type="tip" title="Almost Always a Better Option">
Even for borrowers with bad credit, unsecured personal loans at 25-36% APR or credit union PALs capped at 28% APR are dramatically cheaper than payday loans at 391% APR. Explore alternatives before considering payday lending.
</Callout>

**When payday loans make sense (rarely):** In a genuine one-time emergency where you have no other options, a single payday loan that you can fully repay on time may be preferable to bouncing a check, missing a critical bill, or losing essential services. But this scenario is uncommon, and alternatives almost always exist.

**Better alternatives include:**

- Unsecured personal loans — even for [bad credit](/loans/bad-credit), APRs of 25-36% are dramatically cheaper than payday lending.
- Credit union payday alternative loans (PALs) — federally regulated, capped at 28% APR.
- Payment plans negotiated directly with billers.
- Local assistance programs and nonprofits.

The [FTC](https://consumer.ftc.gov/credit-loans-and-debt) and [FDIC](https://www.fdic.gov/consumer-resource-center) provide additional consumer guidance on alternatives to high-cost borrowing.

## Compare Your Options

The choice between secured and unsecured borrowing comes down to a straightforward trade-off: secured loans cost less but require collateral you can lose; unsecured loans cost more but protect your assets. Your credit score, available collateral, loan amount, and risk tolerance should guide your decision.

No matter which type you choose, comparing offers from multiple lenders is the best way to ensure you get a competitive rate. FundingZest helps you compare loan options from a network of lenders — quickly and without affecting your credit score.
