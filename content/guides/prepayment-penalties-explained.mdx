  - question: "What is a prepayment penalty?"
    answer: "A prepayment penalty is a fee charged by some lenders if you pay off your loan before the scheduled end date. The penalty compensates the lender for interest they would have earned if you'd kept the loan for the full term. Not all loans have prepayment penalties — many online personal loan lenders explicitly do not charge them."
  - question: "How much is a typical prepayment penalty?"
    answer: "Prepayment penalties vary but typically range from 1-5% of the remaining balance, or 1-6 months of interest. For example, on a $5,000 loan with a 2% prepayment penalty and $3,000 remaining, the penalty would be $60. Some penalties decrease over time (e.g., 3% in year 1, 2% in year 2, 1% in year 3)."
  - question: "Do payday loans have prepayment penalties?"
    answer: "No. Payday loans do not have prepayment penalties because they are designed to be repaid in full on a single date. You can pay a payday loan early without any additional fee. Installment loans may or may not have prepayment penalties depending on the lender."
  - question: "Is it still worth paying off early even with a penalty?"
    answer: "Often yes. Calculate the penalty amount and compare it to the interest you'd save by paying early. If the interest savings exceed the penalty, early payoff still makes financial sense. Use a loan calculator to compare scenarios."

Paying off a loan early sounds like it should always be a good thing. You save on interest, free up your monthly budget, and reduce your total debt. But some lenders charge a fee for exactly that — a prepayment penalty that takes a portion of the savings you would otherwise enjoy. Understanding how prepayment penalties work, which loans carry them, and how to avoid them is essential before you sign any loan agreement.

## What Is a Prepayment Penalty?

A prepayment penalty is a fee that a lender charges if you pay off your loan before the scheduled end date. It applies when you pay off the entire remaining balance early, and in some cases, when you pay significantly more than your scheduled monthly payment.

### Why Lenders Charge Them

When a lender approves your loan, they expect to earn a specific amount of interest over the full loan term. If you borrow $5,000 at 18% for 36 months, the lender expects to earn approximately $1,563 in interest. If you pay off the loan at month 12 instead of month 36, the lender collects far less interest — only about $505. The prepayment penalty compensates the lender for that lost revenue.

From the lender's perspective, originating a loan costs money (credit checks, underwriting, processing). The interest earned over the full term is how they recoup those costs and earn a profit. Early payoff disrupts that math.

From your perspective, the penalty reduces or eliminates the financial benefit of paying early. This is why you need to know whether a penalty exists — and how much it would cost — before you sign.

### When the Penalty Is Triggered

Prepayment penalties are typically triggered when you:

- Pay off the entire remaining loan balance before the scheduled final payment date
- Pay a lump sum that exceeds a specified threshold (some agreements set this at 20% of the outstanding balance in a single payment)
- Refinance the loan with a different lender (since refinancing pays off the original loan)

Making slightly larger monthly payments — an extra $20 or $50 per month, for example — usually does not trigger a prepayment penalty, but always check your specific loan agreement.

## Types of Prepayment Penalties

Not all prepayment penalties are calculated the same way. Here are the most common structures:

| Penalty Type | How It Works | Example ($5,000 remaining balance) |
|---|---|---|
| **Percentage of remaining balance** | A flat percentage of whatever you still owe at the time of early payoff | 2% of $5,000 = **$100 penalty** |
| **Flat fee** | A fixed dollar amount regardless of remaining balance | **$150 penalty** (same whether you owe $5,000 or $2,000) |
| **Months of interest** | A set number of months' worth of interest on the remaining balance | 3 months of interest at 15% on $5,000 = **$187.50 penalty** |
| **Declining penalty** | Percentage decreases over the life of the loan | Year 1: 3% ($150), Year 2: 2% ($100), Year 3: 1% ($50) |

Declining penalties are the most borrower-friendly of these structures because they reward you for keeping the loan longer. The penalty shrinks over time and eventually disappears, often by the midpoint of the loan term. If your loan has a declining penalty, waiting until the penalty drops to zero (or close to it) can save you the fee entirely.

## Which Loans Have Prepayment Penalties?

The prevalence of prepayment penalties varies significantly by loan type and lender. Here is what to expect:

| Loan Type | Prepayment Penalty Typical? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| **Online personal loans** | Usually no | Most online lenders advertise no prepayment penalties as a competitive advantage |
| **Credit union personal loans** | Usually no | Credit unions rarely charge prepayment penalties on personal loans |
| **Bank personal loans** | Sometimes | Larger banks and traditional lenders may include prepayment penalties, especially on longer-term loans |
| **Subprime personal loans** | Sometimes | Lenders serving borrowers with lower credit scores may be more likely to include penalties |
| **Mortgages** | Sometimes | Some mortgages include declining prepayment penalties (common in the first 3-5 years). Federal rules prohibit penalties on most qualified mortgages after 3 years |
| **Auto loans** | Varies | Some states prohibit prepayment penalties on auto loans. Check your state's regulations |
| **Payday loans** | No | Payday loans are designed to be repaid in full on a single date. Early repayment is not penalized |
| **Credit cards** | No | You can pay off credit card balances at any time without penalty |

The trend in personal lending is strongly toward no prepayment penalties. Most online lenders have eliminated them, and many advertise this fact prominently. However, "most" is not "all." Never assume — always confirm in writing before you sign.

## How to Check for Prepayment Penalties

A prepayment penalty should never be a surprise. Federal law requires that lenders disclose it before you sign. Here is how to find it:

### 1. Read the Loan Agreement

Look for any of these terms in the loan agreement or promissory note:

- "Prepayment penalty"
- "Early payoff fee"
- "Early termination fee"
- "Prepayment charge"
- "Early repayment"

If any of these terms appear, read the surrounding language carefully. It will specify when the penalty applies, how it is calculated, and whether it declines over time.

### 2. Check the Truth in Lending Disclosure

The federal **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** requires lenders to provide a standardized disclosure document before you sign your loan. This document must state whether a prepayment penalty exists and the terms of that penalty. Look for a line item specifically addressing prepayment. If it says "No" or "None," you are clear. If it says "Yes," read the details.

### 3. Ask the Lender Directly

Ask this specific question: **"Is there any fee or penalty for paying off this loan early, either in full or by making extra payments?"** Get the answer in writing — verbal assurances are not enforceable. If the lender is evasive or unable to give you a clear answer, that is a warning sign. Move on to a different lender.

The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) provides additional guidance on understanding loan disclosures and your rights under TILA.

## Is It Worth Paying Off Early Despite a Penalty?

If your loan does carry a prepayment penalty, paying off early may still save you money. The question is whether the interest you save by paying early exceeds the penalty amount.

### Calculation Example

Suppose you have a $5,000 loan at 24% APR with 24 months remaining. You have the cash to pay it off now.

**Interest remaining if you keep the loan for 24 more months:**

At 24% APR on a declining balance over 24 months, you would pay approximately **$1,335 in total interest** over the remaining term.

**Prepayment penalty:**

The loan agreement specifies a 2% penalty on the remaining balance: 2% of $5,000 = **$100**.

**The math:**

- Interest saved by paying off now: **$1,335**
- Prepayment penalty: **$100**
- **Net savings from early payoff: $1,235**

In this scenario, paying the $100 penalty to save $1,335 in interest is an obvious win. You come out $1,235 ahead.

### When It Might Not Be Worth It

The calculation changes if:

- You are near the end of the loan term (little interest remaining to save)
- The penalty is a large percentage (5% or more) and your rate is low
- The penalty is calculated as several months of interest, making it a significant portion of the remaining interest

Always run the numbers. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to compare the remaining interest under your current schedule against the penalty amount. If the savings exceed the penalty, pay it off. If the penalty is close to or exceeds the savings, you may be better off making scheduled payments.

## How to Avoid Prepayment Penalties

The simplest approach is to choose lenders that do not charge prepayment penalties in the first place. Here is how:

### Choose No-Penalty Lenders

Most online personal loan lenders and credit unions do not charge prepayment penalties. When shopping for a loan, filter for or prioritize lenders that explicitly state "no prepayment penalty." This is one of the first things to confirm before comparing rates and terms.

### Ask Before You Sign

Make "Is there a prepayment penalty?" one of the first questions you ask every lender. Do not wait until you have gone through the full application process to discover a penalty buried in the fine print. See our complete checklist in [10 questions to ask before taking out a loan](/guides/questions-to-ask-before-taking-loan).

### Compare Total Costs

When evaluating offers, factor in the possibility of early payoff. A loan with a slightly higher interest rate but no prepayment penalty may cost less overall if you plan to pay it off ahead of schedule. Our guide on [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers) walks through how to evaluate total cost across different scenarios.

### Read the Fine Print

This cannot be stated strongly enough. The loan agreement is the legally binding document. Everything a lender tells you verbally, displays on a website, or includes in marketing materials is secondary to what the signed agreement says. Read it before you sign. Every page.

## Your Right to Know

Federal law is on your side. The **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** requires lenders to disclose prepayment penalty terms clearly and prominently before you sign the loan agreement. This disclosure must include:

- Whether a prepayment penalty exists
- The conditions under which it applies
- How the penalty is calculated
- The time period during which it applies

If a lender fails to disclose a prepayment penalty and later attempts to charge one, they are in violation of federal law. You have the right to dispute the charge and file a complaint with the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/).

Additionally, for mortgages originated after January 2014, federal rules under the Dodd-Frank Act prohibit prepayment penalties on most "qualified mortgages" after the first three years. This protection does not apply to all personal loans, but the disclosure requirement under TILA applies to every consumer loan product.
