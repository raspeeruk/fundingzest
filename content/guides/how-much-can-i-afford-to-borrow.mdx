  - question: "How do I know if I can afford a loan?"
    answer: "Calculate your debt-to-income ratio after adding the new loan payment. If your total debt payments (including the new loan) are under 36% of your gross monthly income, you can likely afford it. Also check that you have enough left after all expenses for essentials, savings, and unexpected costs."
  - question: "What percentage of my income should go to loan payments?"
    answer: "Financial experts recommend keeping total debt payments (all loans, credit cards, and housing) below 36% of your gross monthly income. The new loan payment alone should ideally be under 10-15% of your income. The lower, the better for your financial health."
  - question: "Should I borrow the maximum amount I'm approved for?"
    answer: "No. Lenders approve you based on what they believe you can technically repay, not what's comfortable for your budget. Always borrow less than your maximum approval. Borrow only what you need for your specific purpose, and ensure the monthly payment fits comfortably in your budget."
  - question: "How do I calculate what monthly payment I can afford?"
    answer: "Start with your monthly take-home pay. Subtract all fixed expenses (rent, utilities, insurance, existing loan payments, groceries). Subtract savings goals (emergency fund, retirement). What remains is your discretionary income. Your loan payment should be a portion of this — leaving room for unexpected expenses."
  - question: "Is it better to borrow more with lower payments or less with higher payments?"
    answer: "It depends on your situation. Borrowing less with higher payments saves money on interest and pays off the debt faster. Borrowing more with lower payments eases monthly cash flow but costs significantly more overall. Always compare the total cost using a loan calculator."

## The Most Important Question Before Borrowing

Before you apply for any loan, the question is not "Can I get approved?" — it is "Can I comfortably afford the payments while still covering everything else in my life?" These are two very different questions, and confusing them is one of the most common financial mistakes people make.

Lenders approve you based on algorithms that calculate whether you can technically repay a loan. Those algorithms do not know that your car needs new tires next month, that your kid has a field trip fee due on Friday, or that your hours at work might get cut. They do not account for the dentist visit you have been putting off or the fact that your rent is about to increase.

Affordability means that after you make the loan payment, you can still cover all your essential expenses, save for emergencies, and have a reasonable buffer for the unexpected. If a loan payment leaves you with zero margin, you cannot afford it — regardless of what a lender approves.

This guide walks you through a step-by-step process to calculate exactly how much you can realistically borrow. Do this math before you apply, not after.

## Step 1: Calculate Your Monthly Income

The foundation of any borrowing decision is knowing exactly how much money you bring in each month. There are two ways to measure this, and you need both.

**Gross monthly income** is your total earnings before taxes, insurance, and retirement contributions are deducted. If your annual salary is $48,000, your gross monthly income is $4,000. If you are paid hourly or your income fluctuates, average the last three to six months of gross earnings.

**Net monthly income (take-home pay)** is what actually hits your bank account after all deductions. This is the number that matters most for your real-world budget. For someone earning $48,000 gross, net pay might be $3,400 after taxes, health insurance, and a 401(k) contribution.

**Why you need both:** Lenders and financial rules of thumb (like the 36% rule discussed below) use gross income for their calculations. But your actual budget — what you can spend and save — is based on net income. Using gross income for personal budgeting is a recipe for coming up short every month.

**Include all income sources:**
- Primary job salary or wages
- Second job or freelance income (use a conservative average if it fluctuates)
- Regular side gig income (DoorDash, Etsy, tutoring)
- Government benefits (Social Security, disability, child support received)
- Investment income or rental income

If any income source is irregular, use the lowest monthly amount from the past six months rather than the average. This protects you from overestimating what you can afford.

## Step 2: List Your Monthly Expenses

You cannot determine how much room you have for a loan payment until you know where your money is already going. Be thorough and honest — this is not the time to estimate low.

### Fixed Expenses (Same Every Month)

- Rent or mortgage payment
- Auto loan or lease payment
- Student loan payments
- Other existing loan payments
- Insurance premiums (health, auto, renters)
- Child care or child support
- Phone bill
- Internet service
- Subscription services (streaming, gym, software)
- Minimum credit card payments

### Variable Expenses (Fluctuate Monthly)

- Groceries
- Gas or transportation costs
- Dining out
- Clothing
- Entertainment
- Personal care and household supplies

### Periodic Expenses (Not Monthly but Predictable)

- Car registration and maintenance (divide annual cost by 12)
- Annual insurance premiums (divide by 12)
- Medical and dental costs (estimate monthly average)
- Holiday and birthday gifts (estimate monthly average)
- Home maintenance or repairs (estimate monthly average)

**The tracking recommendation:** If you have never tracked your spending, do it for one to two months before borrowing. Use your bank and credit card statements to categorize every transaction. Most people underestimate their variable expenses by 20% to 30% when guessing from memory. Free tools like your banking app's spending tracker or a simple spreadsheet work well for this.

## Step 3: Calculate Your Available Cash

Now subtract your total monthly expenses from your net monthly income:

**Net Monthly Income - Total Monthly Expenses = Available Cash**

This is the maximum amount you could theoretically put toward a loan payment each month. But you should **not** allocate all of it to a loan payment. You need a buffer for three reasons:

1. **Unexpected expenses.** Cars break down. Appliances die. Medical bills appear. If every dollar is spoken for, one surprise expense pushes you into a missed payment or more borrowing.
2. **Savings.** If you are not building an emergency fund — even slowly — you are one setback away from a financial crisis. Aim to keep at least 10% to 20% of your available cash earmarked for savings.
3. **Income variability.** If your hours get cut, you lose overtime, or a freelance client delays payment, your available cash shrinks. Your loan payment does not.

A practical guideline: **allocate no more than 50% to 60% of your available cash to a new loan payment.** If your available cash after all expenses is $500 per month, your loan payment should be $250 to $300 at most. This leaves room for life to happen without the loan becoming a source of financial stress.

## Step 4: Apply the Affordability Rules

Financial planners use several frameworks to assess borrowing capacity. None is perfect on its own, but together they give you a reliable picture.

### The 36% Rule (Debt-to-Income Ratio)

Your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is the percentage of your gross monthly income that goes to debt payments. Lenders use this metric heavily in underwriting, and you should use it too.

**DTI = Total Monthly Debt Payments / Gross Monthly Income x 100**

Financial experts recommend keeping your total DTI below 36%. This includes all debt payments — housing, car loans, student loans, credit cards, and any new loan you are considering.

**Example:** If your gross monthly income is $4,000 and your current debt payments total $800:
- Current DTI: $800 / $4,000 = 20%
- Room for new debt before hitting 36%: ($4,000 x 0.36) - $800 = $640 per month

In this scenario, you could afford a new loan payment of up to $640 per month and stay within the 36% guideline. But remember, this is a ceiling, not a target. Lower is always better.

For a deeper understanding of how DTI works and why it matters, read our guide on [understanding debt-to-income ratio](/guides/understanding-debt-to-income-ratio).

### The 50/30/20 Rule

This popular budgeting framework divides your after-tax (net) income into three categories:

- **50% for needs:** Housing, utilities, groceries, insurance, minimum debt payments, transportation
- **30% for wants:** Dining out, entertainment, shopping, hobbies, subscriptions
- **20% for savings and extra debt payments:** Emergency fund, retirement contributions, and paying down debt faster

Under this model, a new loan payment falls into the "needs" category. If your needs already consume 50% of your net income, taking on a new loan payment pushes you past the threshold unless you can reduce spending elsewhere.

### The "Comfortable Payment" Test

This is the most practical rule and the one most people skip. Ask yourself: **Could I still make this loan payment if my income dropped by 10%?**

If the answer is no, the payment is too high. A 10% income reduction is not unusual — it can come from losing overtime, a job change, reduced hours, or a gap between jobs. Your loan payment is a fixed obligation that does not adjust when your income does. Building in a 10% cushion protects you from turning a manageable loan into a financial emergency.

## Step 5: Use a Loan Calculator

Rules of thumb tell you approximately how much you can afford in a monthly payment. A loan calculator translates that into a specific loan amount, APR, and total cost. Before borrowing, plug in your numbers and see exactly what you are committing to.

Here is what different loan scenarios look like in practice:

| Loan Amount | APR | Term | Monthly Payment | Total Interest | Total Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| $1,000 | 36% | 6 months | $186 | $117 | $1,117 |
| $1,000 | 24% | 12 months | $94 | $131 | $1,131 |
| $3,000 | 24% | 12 months | $283 | $393 | $3,393 |
| $3,000 | 24% | 24 months | $159 | $808 | $3,808 |
| $5,000 | 15% | 24 months | $242 | $808 | $5,808 |
| $5,000 | 15% | 36 months | $173 | $1,238 | $6,238 |
| $5,000 | 36% | 24 months | $286 | $1,870 | $6,870 |

Notice the patterns. A $3,000 loan at 24% APR costs $393 in interest over 12 months but $808 over 24 months — more than double. Extending the term lowers your monthly payment but dramatically increases the total cost. A $5,000 loan at 36% APR over 24 months costs $1,870 in interest — more than a third of the loan amount itself.

Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to run your own scenarios. Input the amount you need, the APR you expect to receive based on your credit profile, and different term lengths to find the combination that fits your budget.

## Warning Signs You Are Borrowing Too Much

Certain red flags indicate that a loan will create more problems than it solves. If any of these apply to you, step back and reconsider before signing:

**The payment exceeds 15% of your take-home pay.** If your net monthly income is $3,000 and the loan payment is $500, that is nearly 17% of your income going to a single debt. Combined with your other obligations, this can quickly become unmanageable.

**You need to borrow to cover basic living expenses.** If you are taking out a loan to pay rent, buy groceries, or keep the lights on, the problem is a spending-to-income gap, not a borrowing need. A loan provides temporary relief but adds a new monthly obligation that makes the underlying problem worse.

**You are borrowing to pay off other debts.** Debt consolidation can make sense under the right circumstances — specifically, if you are replacing high-interest debt with a lower-interest loan. But borrowing new money simply to make payments on old money, without addressing the root cause, is a warning sign of a debt spiral.

**You have no emergency savings.** Without even a small cash cushion — $500 to $1,000 — any unexpected expense forces you into more borrowing. Taking on a loan when you have no savings means one car repair or medical bill could push you into missed payments.

**You need the loan to last until your next paycheck.** If the loan is functioning as a bridge to payday, you may be in a cycle that [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) can address more effectively and at a lower cost.

## Borrow Smart: Tips for Getting the Best Deal

If you have done the math and determined that a loan fits your budget, these practices ensure you get the best possible terms:

**Only borrow what you need.** If you need $2,000 for a car repair and a lender approves you for $5,000, borrow $2,000. The extra $3,000 is not free money — it comes with interest, fees, and a larger monthly payment. Borrowing the minimum necessary reduces your total cost and shortens your repayment period.

**Choose the shortest term you can afford.** Shorter loan terms have higher monthly payments but dramatically lower total interest costs. If you can manage $283 per month instead of $159, you save $415 in interest on a $3,000 loan at 24% APR (12 months vs 24 months). Always stretch for the shorter term if your budget allows it.

**Compare APRs across multiple lenders.** Interest rates vary significantly between lenders, even for borrowers with identical credit profiles. A difference of 5 percentage points in APR on a $5,000, 24-month loan changes the total cost by hundreds of dollars. Use our [loan comparison tool](/apply) to see offers from multiple lenders in one place.

**Read the fine print for hidden fees.** Origination fees (typically 1% to 8% of the loan amount), late payment fees, prepayment penalties, and application fees all increase the true cost of borrowing. Some lenders advertise low APRs but charge high origination fees that effectively raise the rate. Ask for the total cost of the loan in dollars, not just the APR.

**Have a repayment plan before you borrow.** Know exactly which budget line item the loan payment will come from and set up autopay before the first payment is due. Borrowers who plan their repayment before they sign the agreement are far less likely to default than those who figure it out as they go.

## What If You Cannot Afford Any Loan?

If you have worked through the steps above and the math says you cannot afford even a small loan payment, that is important information — and it means a loan is not the right solution right now. Borrowing when you cannot afford to repay creates a debt cycle that is far harder to escape than the original financial need.

Instead, consider these alternatives:

**Community assistance programs.** Dial 211 or visit [211.org](https://www.211.org/) to connect with local organizations that provide emergency help with rent, utilities, food, and medical expenses. These resources are free and do not need to be repaid.

**Negotiate directly with creditors.** If your financial need is driven by a specific bill — medical, utility, rent — contact the provider directly. Many offer hardship programs, payment plans, due date adjustments, or temporary forbearance. The cost of asking is zero.

**Employer paycheck advance.** Many employers offer earned wage access programs that let you access a portion of wages you have already earned before payday. The cost is typically $0 to $5 per transaction, with no interest charges.

**Sell items you no longer need.** Facebook Marketplace, OfferUp, and Craigslist can turn unused electronics, furniture, clothing, and household items into immediate cash with no repayment obligation.

**Reduce expenses temporarily.** Cancel subscriptions, pause memberships, switch to a cheaper phone plan, meal plan to reduce grocery costs. Even temporary cuts can free up $100 to $300 per month.

## Ready to Compare Loan Options?

If you have done the math and know what you can afford, the next step is finding the right loan at the best rate. Comparing multiple lenders is the single most effective way to reduce your borrowing costs — even a few percentage points in APR difference can save you hundreds of dollars.

Whether you are looking for a personal [installment loan](/loans/installment), exploring [short-term borrowing options](/loans/payday), or simply want to understand what rates your credit profile qualifies for, start by comparing offers from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's loan resources](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/loans/) and through our lender network.

Borrowing is a tool — not a solution in itself. Used wisely, a loan can help you cover an emergency, consolidate expensive debt, or invest in something that improves your financial position. Used carelessly, it creates obligations that compound over time. Do the math first, borrow only what you need, and make every payment on time. Your future self will thank you.
