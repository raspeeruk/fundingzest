faqs:
  - question: "What is a usury law?"
    answer: "A usury law sets a maximum interest rate that lenders can legally charge. Charging interest above this cap is considered 'usurious' and is illegal. Usury laws vary significantly by state, with caps ranging from 5% to 45% or higher, and many states have different caps for different types of loans."
  - question: "Do usury laws apply to payday loans?"
    answer: "It depends on the state. Many states exempt payday loans from general usury laws through specific payday lending statutes that allow higher rates. Some states apply their usury caps to all consumer loans including payday loans, which effectively bans payday lending when the cap is 36% or lower."
  - question: "What happens if a lender charges more than the legal limit?"
    answer: "Consequences vary by state but may include: the loan being voided entirely, the borrower only being required to repay the principal (no interest), the lender paying penalties or fines, civil lawsuits from borrowers, criminal penalties in some states, and loss of lending license. Enforcement varies significantly."
  - question: "Can national banks ignore state usury laws?"
    answer: "Federally chartered banks can 'export' interest rates from their home state under federal preemption, potentially charging rates above the usury cap in the borrower's state. This is why many credit card companies are headquartered in Delaware or South Dakota, which have no usury caps. This is a significant exception to state-level protections."
  - question: "Why do some states have no interest rate cap?"
    answer: "States without caps (like Utah, Delaware, and South Dakota) generally believe that market competition keeps rates reasonable and that rate caps can reduce credit access for high-risk borrowers. Critics argue that without caps, predatory lending flourishes. This is an ongoing policy debate."

Interest rate caps are one of the oldest forms of consumer protection in existence. Long before modern financial regulation, societies recognized that unchecked lending rates could devastate borrowers and destabilize communities. Today, state usury laws continue to serve that protective function — setting maximum interest rates that lenders can legally charge within each state's borders.

But usury laws are far from simple. Every state has its own rules. Many states set different caps for different loan types. Federal law creates exceptions that allow certain lenders to bypass state limits entirely. And the interaction between usury laws and specific lending products — particularly payday loans, credit cards, and installment loans — creates a regulatory landscape that can be genuinely confusing for borrowers.

This guide explains how usury laws work in practice, what they cover, where the major exceptions lie, and what you can do if you believe a lender has charged you more than the law allows.

## What Are Usury Laws?

Usury laws set a maximum interest rate that lenders can legally charge borrowers. Any interest charged above that maximum is considered "usurious" — an illegal rate — and the lender faces penalties that vary from state to state.

The concept dates back thousands of years. Ancient Roman law capped lending rates. Medieval European law prohibited interest entirely under religious usury doctrines. American colonies adopted usury statutes from English common law, and every state has maintained some form of rate regulation since.

The purpose of usury laws has remained consistent throughout history: prevent lenders from exploiting borrowers by charging interest rates so high that repayment becomes impossible. When a lender charges 400% APR on a loan to someone earning $30,000 a year, the mathematical reality is that the borrower may never escape the debt. Usury laws exist to draw a line and say: beyond this rate, the transaction is not a legitimate loan — it is exploitation.

**Why usury laws matter for borrowers today:**

- They establish the maximum you can legally be charged for borrowing money in your state
- They give you legal recourse if a lender exceeds the cap
- They force lenders to compete on terms rather than simply charging the highest rate the borrower will accept
- They create a baseline standard of fairness in lending markets

However, usury laws are only as protective as their scope. Exemptions, exceptions, and federal preemption rules significantly limit their reach — which is why understanding the full picture matters more than knowing your state's headline cap number.

## How State Usury Laws Work

Each state sets its own interest rate caps through state statute. There is no single federal usury law that applies to all consumer lending (though specific federal laws, like the Military Lending Act, cap rates for certain populations). The result is a patchwork of 50 different regulatory frameworks plus the District of Columbia.

**Key concepts:**

**General usury cap.** Most states have a "general" or "default" usury cap that applies to consumer loans unless a specific exception applies. This cap typically ranges from 5% to 45% depending on the state. If a loan doesn't fall under any specific exemption, the general cap governs.

**Loan-type-specific caps.** Many states set different rate limits for different products. A state might cap general consumer loans at 10% but allow licensed payday lenders to charge $15 per $100 borrowed (equivalent to roughly 391% APR on a two-week loan). Mortgage rates, auto loan rates, and credit card rates may each have separate caps or exemptions.

**Licensed lender exemptions.** In many states, lenders that obtain a specific state license — such as a payday lending license or a consumer finance company license — are permitted to charge rates above the general usury cap. The license comes with regulatory oversight, reporting requirements, and operational rules, but it also grants the ability to charge higher rates than unlicensed lenders.

**Enforcement mechanisms.** What happens when a lender violates the usury cap varies dramatically by state. Some states void the entire loan (the borrower keeps the principal and owes nothing). Others void only the excess interest. Some impose civil penalties — double or triple the usurious interest charged. A handful of states have criminal penalties for usury violations. And in states with weak enforcement, the caps may exist on paper but rarely result in consequences for violators.

## State Usury Caps Overview

The following table provides the general usury cap for each state, whether a separate payday lending statute exists with a different cap, and the general enforcement approach. Because usury laws are complex and frequently updated, always verify your state's current rates through your state's financial regulator or our [state lending laws directory](/states).

### Strict States (General Cap 36% or Lower)

These states have rate caps low enough to significantly restrict or effectively ban traditional payday lending.

These states allow payday lending under specific licensing requirements and fee structures.

| State | General Usury Cap | Payday Loan Cap/Fee Limit | Maximum Loan Amount |
|---|---|---|---|
| Alabama | 8% (general) | $17.50 per $100 | $500 |

| Wisconsin | 5% (general) | No specific cap for licensed lenders | No statutory maximum |
| Wyoming | 7% (general) | No specific cap for licensed lenders | No statutory maximum |

### Permissive States (No Usury Cap or Very High Cap)

These states have no general usury cap, very high caps, or broad exemptions that allow significantly higher rates.

| State | General Usury Cap | Payday Lending Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Delaware | None (no general cap) | Permitted under licensed lender statute | Major credit card issuer headquarters state |
| Idaho | No cap for written agreements | Permitted; up to $1,000 | Rates set by contract between parties |
| Nevada | No general cap for licensed lenders | Permitted; 25% of gross monthly income max | Licensed lenders exempt from general usury |
| New Mexico | No general cap specified | Permitted; $2,500 max | 175% APR cap for small loans under NMSA |
| North Dakota | 5.5% (general); no cap for licensed lenders | Permitted; $500 max | Licensed lender exemption is broad |
| South Dakota | None (no general cap) | Permitted | No rate cap — voter-rejected an attempt in 2016 (note: passed in 2016 ballot) |
| Utah | None (no general cap) | Permitted; no loan amount cap | No rate cap; market-rate lending permitted |

**Important note on South Dakota:** South Dakota voters approved a 36% rate cap ballot measure in 2016. The state appears in both the "strict" and "permissive" categories in various sources depending on the loan type and specific statute referenced. The 36% cap applies to money lenders, but federally chartered banks headquartered in South Dakota are not subject to this state cap.

## States with No Usury Cap

A handful of states — notably Delaware, Utah, and South Dakota (for certain lender types) — have no general usury cap or have caps so high they are functionally irrelevant. Understanding why these states exist this way is important because their policies have consequences far beyond their borders.

**Why these states matter nationally:** Under federal law, nationally chartered banks can "export" the interest rate laws of their home state to borrowers in any other state. This means a bank headquartered in Delaware — which has no general usury cap — can charge a borrower in New York an interest rate that would be illegal for a New York-based lender to charge. This is the foundation of the modern credit card industry and explains why the largest credit card issuers are headquartered in a small number of states.

**The policy arguments:**

Those who favor no-cap states argue that rate caps restrict credit access — if a lender cannot charge a rate that compensates for the risk of lending to a high-risk borrower, that borrower gets no loan at all. They argue that market competition, not regulation, is the best mechanism for keeping rates fair.

Those who oppose the no-cap approach point to evidence that unrestricted rates lead to predatory lending, particularly among vulnerable populations. When a lender can charge 400% APR or more, the incentive shifts from making loans that borrowers can repay to making loans that generate maximum fee income regardless of borrower outcomes.

The debate is unresolved, and your view may depend on whether you weight credit access or rate protection more heavily. What is not debatable is that these states' policies have national implications through the bank exportation doctrine.

## States with Strong Rate Caps

At the other end of the spectrum, approximately 18 states and the District of Columbia have implemented rate caps of 36% APR or lower on consumer loans. This threshold is significant because the traditional payday lending business model — charging $15 per $100 for a two-week loan — produces an APR of approximately 391%. A 36% cap makes this model mathematically impossible.

**How 36% caps protect consumers:**

- They eliminate the highest-cost short-term lending products from the market
- They force remaining lenders to offer longer terms and lower rates to stay under the cap
- Research from states that have implemented 36% caps shows that consumers do not lose meaningful access to credit — they shift to lower-cost alternatives including installment loans, credit union products, and employer-based advances

**The tradeoff:** In states with strict caps, some borrowers who would have used payday loans cannot find equivalent short-term credit. Critics of strict caps argue this pushes borrowers toward less regulated alternatives — including unlicensed online lenders, loan sharks, and informal borrowing arrangements with worse terms and no consumer protections. Advocates counter that these caps prevent more harm than they cause and that most borrowers find suitable alternatives.

## Exceptions and Loopholes

Usury laws would be straightforward if they applied uniformly to every loan. They do not. Several major exceptions significantly limit their reach.

### Licensed Lender Exemptions

Most states allow lenders who obtain a specific state license — such as a consumer finance license, small loan license, or payday lending license — to charge rates above the general usury cap. The theory is that state licensing provides regulatory oversight (reporting requirements, examinations, consumer complaint processes) that substitutes for rate caps. In practice, this means the general usury cap you see listed for your state may not apply to the lender you're actually borrowing from.

### Federal Preemption for National Banks

Federally chartered banks (those with "National" in their name or "N.A." after it) are governed by federal law, which preempts state usury caps. Under the National Bank Act and subsequent Supreme Court rulings, a national bank can charge the interest rate permitted by the state where it is headquartered to borrowers in any state. This principle — known as "rate exportation" — means that a national bank based in Utah (no usury cap) can legally charge a borrower in New York (16% usury cap) a rate that would be usurious for any New York-based lender.

### Tribal Sovereign Immunity Claims

Some online lenders are owned by or affiliated with Native American tribes and claim sovereign immunity from state usury laws. The legal basis for these claims is contested. Some courts have upheld tribal immunity for lending operations genuinely controlled by and benefiting the tribe. Others have rejected immunity claims where the tribal affiliation is a shell arrangement designed primarily to evade state regulation — so-called "rent-a-tribe" schemes. If you are considering borrowing from a tribal lender, be aware that your state's usury cap may or may not apply, and legal recourse may be limited.

### Rent-a-Bank Arrangements

In a rent-a-bank arrangement, a non-bank lender partners with a nationally chartered bank to originate loans. The bank technically makes the loan (benefiting from federal preemption of state usury laws), then sells or assigns the loan to the non-bank partner. The non-bank partner services the loan and bears the economic risk, but the bank's involvement allows the loan to carry a rate that would be illegal for the non-bank partner to charge on its own.

Regulators at both the state and federal level have scrutinized these arrangements. The CFPB and some state attorneys general have argued that they are designed to circumvent state consumer protections. Others maintain they are legitimate business arrangements that expand credit access. The legal landscape here is evolving, and borrowers should be aware that a loan originated by a bank in a no-cap state may carry a significantly higher rate than your state would otherwise allow.

## Credit Card Interest and Usury

If your state caps interest rates at 16%, why does your credit card charge 24%? This is one of the most common questions about usury laws, and the answer is federal preemption.

Most major credit card issuers are nationally chartered banks headquartered in either Delaware or South Dakota — both of which have no general usury cap. Under the exportation doctrine established by the Supreme Court's 1978 decision in *Marquette National Bank v. First of Omaha Service Corp.*, these banks can charge the interest rate permitted by their home state to cardholders in all 50 states.

This is why credit card interest rates are effectively unregulated by state usury laws. The 24.99% APR on your credit card is legal not because your state permits it, but because Delaware — where the issuing bank is chartered — has no cap.

**What this means for you as a borrower:**

- Your state's usury cap probably does not protect you when it comes to credit card interest rates
- The same principle applies to many other national bank products, including personal loans and auto loans originated by national banks
- State usury caps primarily protect you from state-chartered lenders, credit unions (which have their own federal cap of 18% under the Federal Credit Union Act, with exceptions), and non-bank lenders operating under state licenses

Understanding this distinction helps you calibrate your expectations. Usury laws provide meaningful protection against locally licensed lenders, but they do not create an absolute ceiling on the interest rate you can be charged across all products and all lenders.

## How Usury Laws Affect Payday Loans

The intersection of usury laws and [payday lending](/loans/payday) is where the most consequential policy battles occur. The way a state handles this intersection determines whether payday lending exists within its borders and, if so, how much it costs.

**Three approaches states take:**

**Apply the general usury cap to payday loans (effectively banning them).** States like New York (16% cap), Arkansas (17% constitutional cap), and Georgia (5% cap with 60% criminal threshold) do not create separate statutes for payday lending. The general usury cap applies, and since payday lending is not viable at these rates, it does not exist as a licensed industry in these states.

**Create separate payday lending statutes with higher rate allowances.** States like California ($15 per $100 on loans up to $300), Florida ($10-$15 per $100), and Alabama ($17.50 per $100) have enacted specific payday lending laws that exempt licensed payday lenders from the general usury cap. These statutes set their own fee limits, loan amount caps, term requirements, and consumer protections.

**Allow market-rate lending with minimal restrictions.** States like Utah and Nevada have minimal rate restrictions and broadly permissive licensing frameworks that allow payday lenders to charge whatever rate the market will bear.

**The 36% APR threshold.** In the payday lending policy debate, 36% APR has emerged as the critical dividing line. At 36% APR, a $500 two-week loan generates approximately $13.85 in interest — far too little to cover the lender's origination costs, default losses, and overhead. The traditional payday lending model requires rates in the range of $15 per $100 (approximately 391% APR) to be economically viable. Any rate cap at or below 36% effectively eliminates traditional payday lending from the market.

This is why consumer advocacy groups frequently push for 36% caps — it is the rate at which the highest-cost lending products are priced out of the market while still permitting a wide range of other consumer lending products to operate profitably.

## What to Do If You Think You've Been Charged Too Much

If you believe a lender has charged you an interest rate above your state's legal limit, take these steps.

**Step 1: Identify your state's specific limits.** General usury caps are just the starting point. Determine whether the lender holds a license that exempts them from the general cap, and if so, what the cap is under that specific licensing statute. Your state's financial regulatory agency website is the most reliable source for current rate limits by lender type.

**Step 2: Compare the rate charged to the legal limit.** Review your loan agreement to find the APR, finance charge, and total cost of borrowing. Compare these figures to the applicable legal limit. Remember that fees, origination charges, and other costs may be included in the usury calculation depending on your state's definition.

**Step 3: File a complaint with your state's financial regulator.** Every state has an agency that oversees lending (often called the Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banking, or Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection). File a formal complaint. Include your loan documents, the rate charged, and the legal limit you believe has been exceeded.

**Step 4: File a complaint with the CFPB.** Even though the CFPB does not enforce state usury laws directly, it tracks complaints against lenders and may take enforcement action under federal law if it identifies patterns of harmful practices. File at [consumerfinance.gov/complaint](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/).

**Step 5: Consult a consumer protection attorney.** If you've been charged a usurious rate, you may have a private right of action under your state's usury statute. Remedies can include voiding the interest entirely, recovering damages equal to double or triple the excess interest, and in some states, voiding the entire loan (meaning you owe nothing — not even the principal). Many consumer attorneys offer free initial consultations and take usury cases on contingency.

**Step 6: Document everything.** Keep copies of all loan documents, payment records, bank statements showing withdrawals, and any communications with the lender. This documentation is essential for complaints and legal proceedings.

Knowing [your rights as a borrower](/guides/your-rights-as-borrower) is the first step toward enforcing them. If you're unsure whether a lender has violated the law, the process of investigating is free — and the potential recovery can be significant.

## Check Your State's Laws

Usury laws are state-specific, and the details matter more than the headlines. A 10% general cap with a licensed lender exemption allowing 400% APR on payday loans produces very different outcomes than a flat 36% cap with no exemptions. The only way to understand the protections available to you is to check the specific laws in your state.

Visit our [state lending laws directory](/states) for a state-by-state breakdown of rate caps, payday lending rules, licensing requirements, and enforcement agencies. If you're considering a [payday loan](/loans/payday) or [installment loan](/loans/installment), knowing your state's rules before you apply ensures you can recognize an illegal rate and hold lenders accountable.

## Key Takeaways

- Usury laws set maximum interest rates that lenders can legally charge, but every state defines its own caps — and most have multiple caps for different loan types
- General usury caps range from 5% to over 45% depending on the state; some states (Delaware, Utah) have no general cap at all
- Licensed lender exemptions allow payday lenders in many states to charge rates far above the general usury cap under separate statutes
- Federal preemption allows nationally chartered banks to export their home state's rate to borrowers in any state — which is why credit card rates are not limited by your state's usury cap
- The 36% APR threshold is the effective dividing line: states with caps at or below 36% eliminate traditional payday lending; states above it permit payday lending in some form
- If you've been charged above the legal limit, file complaints with your state financial regulator and the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/), and consult a consumer protection attorney — remedies can include voiding the loan entirely
- Tribal sovereign immunity claims and rent-a-bank arrangements are contested legal mechanisms some lenders use to avoid state rate caps — the law in these areas continues to evolve
- Check your specific state's laws at our [state lending laws directory](/states) before borrowing, and visit the [NCSL payday lending resource](https://www.ncsl.org/financial-services/payday-lending-state-statutes) for legislative updates
