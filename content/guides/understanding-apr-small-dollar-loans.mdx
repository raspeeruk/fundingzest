faqs:
  - question: "Why is the APR on payday loans so high?"
    answer: "Payday loan APR appears extremely high (often 300-700%) because APR annualizes the cost of borrowing. A $15 fee on a $100 two-week loan is a 15% fee for that period. When you annualize that rate (multiply by 26 two-week periods per year), it becomes 391%. The fee itself may be $15, but APR shows what that fee would cost if applied repeatedly for a full year."
  - question: "Is APR or the total dollar cost more important?"
    answer: "Both matter, but for different reasons. The total dollar cost tells you exactly how much you'll pay for this specific loan — it's the practical number. APR lets you compare across different loan types, amounts, and terms on a standardized basis. For one-time short-term borrowing, focus on total dollar cost. For deciding between a payday loan and an installment loan, APR is the better comparison tool."
  - question: "What is a 'good' APR for a personal loan?"
    answer: "For traditional personal loans, APRs range from 6% to 36%. Below 12% is excellent (typically requires good to excellent credit), 12-20% is average, and 20-36% is on the higher end (common for fair credit). For subprime borrowers or small-dollar loans, APRs can legally range from 36% to 199% for installment products. Payday loans typically carry APRs above 200%."
  - question: "Does APR include all fees?"
    answer: "By law (Truth in Lending Act), the APR disclosed to you must include interest charges and certain mandatory fees like origination fees. However, some costs may not be included: late fees (since they're conditional), NSF/returned payment fees, optional services, and some application fees. Always ask the lender for the total cost of the loan in addition to the APR."
  - question: "Can the APR change after I take out a loan?"
    answer: "For fixed-rate loans (including most payday and installment loans), the APR cannot change after you sign the agreement. For variable-rate loans, the APR can increase or decrease based on market rates. All payday loans and nearly all small-dollar installment loans are fixed-rate — the cost disclosed at signing is the cost you'll pay."

## What Is APR and Why Does It Matter?

APR — Annual Percentage Rate — is the standardized way to express how much a loan costs per year. It includes both the interest rate and certain mandatory fees, converted into a single annual percentage.

The federal Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires every lender to disclose APR before you sign a loan agreement. The purpose is straightforward: give borrowers a single number they can use to compare costs across different lenders, loan types, and terms.

**Why APR exists:** Without APR, comparing a payday loan fee of "$15 per $100 for 14 days" against an installment loan at "8% monthly interest for 6 months" would require complex math. APR translates both into the same unit — cost per year — so you can compare directly.

## How APR Is Calculated

The basic formula for APR on a simple interest loan:

**APR = (Fee ÷ Loan Amount) × (365 ÷ Loan Term in Days) × 100**

### Example 1: Payday Loan
- Loan amount: $500
- Fee: $75 ($15 per $100)
- Term: 14 days

APR = ($75 ÷ $500) × (365 ÷ 14) × 100 = 0.15 × 26.07 × 100 = **391%**

### Example 2: 3-Month Installment Loan
- Loan amount: $500
- Total interest paid: $65
- Term: 90 days

APR = ($65 ÷ $500) × (365 ÷ 90) × 100 = 0.13 × 4.06 × 100 = **52.7%**

### Example 3: Credit Card Cash Advance
- Amount: $500
- Interest rate: 28% APR
- Cash advance fee: 5% ($25)
- Held for 30 days

Interest for 30 days: $500 × 0.28 ÷ 365 × 30 = $11.51
Total cost: $25 + $11.51 = $36.51
Effective APR (including fee): approximately **89%** for a 30-day period

## APR in Context: What the Numbers Actually Mean

Here's a side-by-side comparison showing how APR translates into actual dollar costs for a $500 loan:

| Loan Type | APR | Term | Total Fees/Interest | Total Repayment |
|-----------|-----|------|--------------------|-----------------|
| Credit card purchase | 22% | 6 months | $33 | $533 |
| Credit union PAL | 28% | 3 months | $18 | $518 |
| Online installment (prime) | 36% | 6 months | $56 | $556 |
| Online installment (subprime) | 99% | 6 months | $149 | $649 |
| Credit card cash advance | 28% + 5% fee | 1 month | $37 | $537 |
| Payday loan (one-time) | 391% | 14 days | $75 | $575 |
| Payday loan (3 rollovers) | 391% | 8 weeks | $300 | $800 |

**The critical insight:** A 391% APR payday loan costs $75 if used once as designed. But the same payday loan rolled over three times costs $300 — while a 99% APR installment loan over 6 months costs $149 total with predictable monthly payments.

APR alone doesn't tell the full story. How you use the loan — and whether you roll it over — determines the true cost.

## Why Payday Loan APR Looks Shocking (and Why It's Still Useful)

When people see "391% APR" on a payday loan disclosure, the reaction is usually alarm. But context matters:

### The Argument That APR Is Misleading for Short-Term Loans

Payday loans aren't designed to be held for a year. Applying an annual rate to a 14-day product makes the number look far worse than the actual dollar cost. A $15 fee on $100 borrowed for two weeks is $15 — not $391.

Critics argue this is like calculating the daily rate of a hotel room, multiplying by 365, and calling it "$54,750 per year for housing." The number is technically correct but doesn't reflect how the product is used.

### The Argument That APR Is Still the Right Metric

Defenders of APR disclosure point out:

1. **80% of payday loans are rolled over.** The product isn't actually used for just 14 days by most borrowers — CFPB data shows the average borrower is in debt for 5 months per year
2. **Standardization enables comparison.** Without APR, it's harder to see that a $500 payday loan at $15 per $100 every 2 weeks costs more than a $500 installment loan at 99% APR
3. **Cumulative cost matters.** A "small" $75 fee repeated 10 times is $750 — more than the original loan amount

**Our view:** APR is imperfect for one-time, short-term use but essential for comparing options and understanding rollover risk. Use it alongside the total dollar cost for the clearest picture.

## How to Use APR to Compare Loan Offers

### Step 1: Get the APR From Each Lender

By law, every lender must tell you the APR before you sign. If a lender won't disclose APR, do not proceed.

### Step 2: Compare the Total Dollar Cost

APR alone isn't enough. Ask each lender:

- What is the **total amount I will repay?**
- Are there any **additional fees** not included in the APR? (late fees, NSF fees, prepayment penalties)
- What happens if I **can't repay on time?** (rollover fees, extended payment plan availability)

### Step 3: Factor In the Repayment Structure

A lower APR with a lump-sum repayment may be riskier than a slightly higher APR with monthly installments:

| Option A | Option B |
|----------|----------|
| $500 payday loan | $500 installment loan |
| 391% APR | 120% APR |
| $75 fee, due in 14 days | $183 total interest, $114/month for 6 months |
| **Risk:** If you can't repay $575 in a lump sum, rollover fees accumulate | **Lower risk:** $114/month is more manageable than $575 at once |

### Step 4: Calculate Your Ability to Repay

Before accepting any loan, answer honestly:

- Can I repay the full amount (principal + fees) on the due date?
- If it's a lump-sum payment, will I have enough left for my regular expenses?
- If I can't repay, what are the penalties and options?

If the answer to the first question is "probably not," a longer-term installment loan at a nominally higher APR may cost less in practice.

## APR Caps by State

Many states set maximum APR or fee caps for small-dollar loans. Here's how the landscape breaks down:

**States with 36% APR cap or lower (payday lending effectively banned):**
Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, D.C.

**States with moderate caps ($10-$15 per $100):**
Many states cap payday loan fees at $10-$15 per $100, which translates to approximately 260%-391% APR for a 14-day loan.

**States with minimal caps or no caps:**
A small number of states have higher limits or fewer restrictions on small-dollar lending fees.

## Key Terms You Should Know

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate):** The annualized cost of borrowing, including interest and certain fees. Required disclosure under federal law.

**Interest rate:** The percentage charged on the loan balance over time. May differ from APR because APR includes additional fees.

**Finance charge:** The total dollar cost of the loan — includes interest and all mandatory fees. This is the number that tells you exactly how much borrowing costs.

**Origination fee:** A one-time fee charged by some lenders for processing the loan. Included in APR calculation.

**Rollover fee:** The fee charged to extend a payday loan's due date. Each rollover adds a new fee while the principal remains unpaid.

**Principal:** The original amount borrowed, before any fees or interest are added.

## Key Takeaways

- APR standardizes loan costs so you can compare across different products and terms
- For payday loans, the APR (300-700%+) reflects what the fee would cost over a full year — the actual one-time cost is the flat fee
- Total dollar cost and repayment structure matter as much as APR
- A 99% APR installment loan with monthly payments is often cheaper and safer than a 391% APR payday loan that gets rolled over
- State APR caps vary dramatically — approximately 18 states effectively ban high-cost payday lending
- Always ask for both the APR and the total repayment amount before signing any loan agreement
