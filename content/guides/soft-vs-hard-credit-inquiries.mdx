faqs:
  - question: "How many points does a hard inquiry cost?"
    answer: "A single hard inquiry typically lowers your credit score by 5-10 points. The impact is temporary — it affects your score for about 12 months and falls off your report after 2 years. If you have a long credit history with many accounts, the impact is usually on the lower end."
  - question: "Does checking my own credit count as a hard inquiry?"
    answer: "No. Checking your own credit score or pulling your own credit report is always a soft inquiry with zero impact on your score. You can check as often as you like through AnnualCreditReport.com, your bank's app, or free services like Credit Karma."
  - question: "Do multiple loan applications count as multiple hard inquiries?"
    answer: "Not always. FICO treats multiple inquiries for the same type of loan (mortgage, auto, student) within a 14-45 day window as a single inquiry for scoring purposes. This is called 'rate shopping.' However, multiple credit card applications are counted separately."
  - question: "Does FundingZest perform a hard credit check?"
    answer: "No. Submitting your information through FundingZest does not result in a hard credit inquiry. If you are matched with a lender and choose to proceed, the lender may perform a hard inquiry as part of their own approval process."
  - question: "Can I remove hard inquiries from my credit report?"
    answer: "You can dispute unauthorized hard inquiries — those you did not initiate or consent to. If a company pulled your credit without your permission, file a dispute with the credit bureau. Legitimate hard inquiries that you authorized cannot be removed early; they will fall off after 2 years."

Every time someone checks your credit, it is recorded on your credit report as an inquiry. But not all inquiries are created equal. Some have zero effect on your credit score, while others can temporarily lower it. Understanding the difference between soft and hard credit inquiries — and knowing how to manage them — is essential for anyone who wants to protect their score while shopping for the best loan rates.

This guide explains what each type of inquiry is, how they affect your score, and how to minimize unnecessary hard pulls when you are ready to borrow.

## What Is a Credit Inquiry?

A credit inquiry occurs any time a person or organization requests access to your credit report. This can happen for many reasons: you apply for a credit card, a landlord screens your rental application, or you simply check your own score through a free service.

All inquiries fall into one of two categories:

- **Soft inquiries** (also called soft pulls) — Informational checks that do not affect your credit score.
- **Hard inquiries** (also called hard pulls) — Checks triggered by a credit application that can temporarily lower your score.

The distinction matters because only hard inquiries impact your credit score. Understanding when each type occurs helps you make informed decisions about when and how to apply for credit.

## Hard Inquiries Explained

A hard inquiry is recorded on your credit report when a lender or creditor checks your credit as part of a lending decision. This happens because you have applied for credit and given the lender permission to pull your report. Hard inquiries require your consent — a company cannot perform one without your authorization.

### When Hard Inquiries Happen

| Situation | Type of Inquiry | Score Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Applying for a credit card | Hard inquiry | Yes — 5-10 points |
| Applying for a mortgage | Hard inquiry | Yes — 5-10 points |
| Applying for an auto loan | Hard inquiry | Yes — 5-10 points |
| Applying for a personal loan | Hard inquiry | Yes — 5-10 points |
| Applying for a student loan (private) | Hard inquiry | Yes — 5-10 points |
| Some apartment rental applications | Hard inquiry | Yes — 5-10 points |
| Applying for a new cell phone plan (some carriers) | Hard inquiry | Yes — 5-10 points |

### How Long Hard Inquiries Last

A hard inquiry remains on your credit report for **two years** from the date it was made. However, the actual impact on your credit score is much shorter — most scoring models only factor hard inquiries from the **past 12 months** into your score calculation. After 12 months, the inquiry is still visible on your report but is no longer affecting your number.

This means that even if you have a hard inquiry from 18 months ago, it is not actively hurting your score anymore. It will simply sit on your report as a historical record until it drops off at the two-year mark.

### The Consent Requirement

Federal law requires your explicit permission before a hard inquiry can be performed. If you see a hard inquiry on your credit report that you did not authorize, you have the right to dispute it with the credit bureau. Unauthorized hard inquiries can be a sign of identity theft or an error by a company that pulled your credit without proper consent.

## Soft Inquiries Explained

A soft inquiry occurs when your credit is checked for reasons that are not related to a lending decision, or when you check your own credit. Soft inquiries are recorded on your credit report, but they are only visible to you — lenders cannot see them, and they have absolutely zero impact on your credit score.

### When Soft Inquiries Happen

| Situation | Type of Inquiry | Score Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Checking your own credit score or report | Soft inquiry | None |
| Pre-approval or pre-qualification offers from lenders | Soft inquiry | None |
| Employer background checks | Soft inquiry | None |
| Insurance companies checking your credit | Soft inquiry | None |
| Existing creditors reviewing your account | Soft inquiry | None |
| Using FundingZest to check loan options | Soft inquiry | None |
| Credit monitoring services (Credit Karma, etc.) | Soft inquiry | None |
| Utility companies checking credit for new service | Soft inquiry (usually) | None |

The key difference is purpose. Soft inquiries are informational — they are used to assess your credit profile without making a lending decision. Because they do not signal that you are actively seeking new credit, scoring models ignore them entirely.

You can check your own credit score and credit report as often as you want without any negative consequences. This is an important point because many people avoid checking their credit out of a mistaken belief that it will lower their score. It will not. For all the free ways to monitor your credit, see our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free).

## How Hard Inquiries Affect Your Score

A single hard inquiry typically reduces your credit score by **5 to 10 points**. The exact impact depends on several factors in your overall credit profile.

### Factors That Influence the Impact

**Number of recent inquiries.** If you have had several hard inquiries in the past 12 months, each additional one may have a slightly larger effect because it creates a pattern of credit-seeking behavior.

**Length of credit history.** Borrowers with longer credit histories tend to see smaller impacts from hard inquiries. If you have 15 years of credit history, one more inquiry is a small data point in a large picture. If you have only 1-2 years of history, a hard inquiry represents a proportionally larger event.

**Total number of accounts.** A well-established credit profile with many accounts in good standing absorbs the impact of a hard inquiry more easily than a thin file with only a few accounts.

**Overall credit health.** If the rest of your profile is strong — on-time payments, low utilization, no negative marks — a hard inquiry is a minor and temporary dip. If your profile is already marginal, an additional inquiry can push your score below a lender's threshold.

### The Impact Is Temporary

<ComparisonRow title="Hard Inquiry vs Late Payment: Impact on Your Score" options={[
  { title: "Hard Inquiry", variant: "green", stats: [{ label: "Score Drop", value: "5-10 pts" }, { label: "Scoring Impact", value: "12 months" }, { label: "On Report", value: "2 years" }] },
  { title: "Late Payment", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "Score Drop", value: "60-110 pts" }, { label: "Scoring Impact", value: "Years" }, { label: "On Report", value: "7 years" }] }
]} />

Hard inquiries are the least damaging of all negative credit events. Compared to a late payment (which can drop your score 60-110 points and stay on your report for 7 years) or a collection (50-110 point drop, 7 years on report), a hard inquiry's 5-10 point impact for 12 months is relatively minor. The concern is not about one inquiry — it is about accumulating too many in a short period.

## Rate Shopping Protection

The creators of the FICO scoring model recognized that consumers sometimes need to apply to multiple lenders to find the best rate — particularly for large loans like mortgages and auto loans. Penalizing responsible comparison shopping would be unfair. To address this, FICO built in a **rate shopping window**.

### How It Works

When you apply for the same type of loan with multiple lenders within a short window of time, FICO treats all of those inquiries as a **single inquiry** for scoring purposes. The window is 14 to 45 days, depending on the version of the FICO scoring model your lender uses. Newer FICO versions use a 45-day window; older versions use 14 days.

This means you can apply to five different mortgage lenders in two weeks and only have it count as one hard inquiry against your score. The same applies to auto loans and student loans.

### What Qualifies for Rate Shopping

| Loan Type | Rate Shopping Protection? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Mortgage applications | Yes | All inquiries within 14-45 days count as one |
| Auto loan applications | Yes | All inquiries within 14-45 days count as one |
| Student loan applications | Yes | All inquiries within 14-45 days count as one |
| Credit card applications | No | Each application counts as a separate inquiry |
| Retail store card applications | No | Each application counts as a separate inquiry |
| Personal loan applications | Varies | Some newer FICO models include them; older models do not |

### How to Take Advantage of Rate Shopping

1. **Decide which type of loan you need** before you start applying.
2. **Do all your comparison shopping within a 2-week window.** This is the safest approach because it falls within even the oldest FICO model's rate shopping window.
3. **Apply to multiple lenders during that window.** Get quotes from at least 3-5 lenders to ensure you are finding the best rate. Even small differences in APR can save hundreds or thousands of dollars over the life of a loan.
4. **Do not mix loan types.** Rate shopping protection applies within a single loan category. If you apply for an auto loan and a credit card in the same week, they are treated as two separate inquiries.

## How Many Hard Inquiries Are Too Many?

<StatHighlight value="6+" label="hard inquiries in 12 months is generally considered a red flag by lenders" icon="warning" variant="red" />

There is no official cutoff — scoring models do not have a bright line that says "this many inquiries is too many." However, as a practical guideline, **six or more hard inquiries in 12 months** is generally considered a red flag by lenders.

### The Lender Perspective

When a lender sees numerous recent hard inquiries, it signals one of two things: the borrower is aggressively seeking credit (possibly because they are in financial distress), or the borrower has been repeatedly denied and is applying elsewhere. Neither interpretation is favorable.

Some lenders have explicit inquiry limits. Certain credit card issuers (Chase's "5/24 rule" is the most well-known) will automatically deny applications from consumers who have opened 5 or more new credit accounts in the past 24 months. Other lenders may not have formal rules but will view heavy inquiry activity unfavorably during manual underwriting.

### Impact by Credit Profile

The effect of multiple inquiries depends heavily on the rest of your credit profile:

- **Strong credit profile (720+, long history, low utilization):** Multiple inquiries are a minor concern. The strong foundation absorbs the impact.
- **Moderate credit profile (650-719):** Multiple inquiries can tip the balance. A 10-20 point drop from several inquiries could push you into a lower tier with higher rates.
- **Weak credit profile (below 650):** Every point matters. Unnecessary inquiries can be the difference between approval and denial.

## How to Minimize Hard Inquiries

Protecting your credit score from unnecessary hard inquiries is straightforward with a few smart habits.

<Callout type="tip" title="Use Pre-Qualification Tools First">
Many lenders and platforms like FundingZest let you see estimated rates with only a **soft pull** that has zero impact on your score. Only proceed to a full application (hard pull) once you have identified the best offer.
</Callout>

**Use pre-qualification tools.** Many lenders offer pre-qualification or pre-approval checks that use a soft pull. This lets you see estimated rates and terms without affecting your score. Only proceed to a full application (which triggers the hard pull) once you have identified the best offer.

**Rate shop within a narrow window.** As discussed above, keep all applications for the same loan type within a 14-day window to ensure they are bundled as a single inquiry.

**Avoid applying for credit you do not need.** Retail store cards, promotional credit offers, and "just to see if I qualify" applications all generate hard inquiries. If you do not genuinely need the credit, do not apply.

**Ask before you authorize.** Before agreeing to a credit check, ask the company whether they will perform a hard or soft inquiry. This is particularly relevant for apartment applications, utility setups, and cell phone contracts, where the type of inquiry varies by company.

**Space out credit applications.** If you need multiple types of credit (for example, a credit card and an auto loan), apply for them several months apart rather than in the same week.
