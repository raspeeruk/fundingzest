faqs:
  - question: "How often should I check my credit report?"
    answer: "Check your credit report at least once a year from each bureau. Since you can now access free weekly reports through AnnualCreditReport.com, consider checking one bureau every few months on a rotating basis. Check all three before applying for a major loan."
  - question: "Why are my three credit reports different?"
    answer: "Each bureau (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) collects data independently. Not all creditors report to all three bureaus, and timing of updates varies. Small differences are normal. Large discrepancies (like an account appearing on one report but not others) should be investigated."
  - question: "What does 'derogatory' mean on my credit report?"
    answer: "A derogatory mark is a negative item indicating you failed to meet the terms of a credit agreement. Examples include late payments (30+ days), charge-offs, collections, foreclosures, repossessions, and bankruptcies. These significantly lower your credit score and remain on your report for 7-10 years."
  - question: "How long do items stay on my credit report?"
    answer: "Most negative items stay for 7 years from the date of first delinquency. Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays for 10 years. Hard inquiries stay for 2 years. Positive accounts remain for 10 years after closure. Open accounts in good standing stay indefinitely."
  - question: "What is a 'tradeline' on a credit report?"
    answer: "A tradeline is any credit account listed on your report — credit cards, loans, mortgages, auto loans, student loans, and lines of credit. Each tradeline shows the creditor name, account number (partially masked), balance, credit limit, payment history, and account status."

Your credit report is the foundation of your entire financial profile. It is the raw data that credit scoring models use to calculate your score, and it is the document that lenders, landlords, insurers, and sometimes employers review when making decisions about you. Understanding how to read it is not optional — it is one of the most important financial skills you can develop.

Despite how much rides on credit reports, most people have never read theirs. And among those who have, many skim through without fully understanding what they are looking at. That is a problem, because errors on credit reports are far more common than most consumers realize. <StatHighlight value="1 in 4" label="consumers identified errors on their credit reports that could affect their scores (FTC)" icon="warning" variant="red" />

A Federal Trade Commission (FTC) study found that roughly [1 in 4 consumers identified errors on their credit reports](https://consumer.ftc.gov/credit-loans-and-debt) that could affect their scores. Some of those errors are minor. Others are severe enough to result in loan denials, higher interest rates, or rejected rental applications.

This guide walks you through every section of your credit report so you know exactly what you are looking at, what matters, and what to do if something is wrong.

## Why Your Credit Report Matters

Your credit report is the source document for virtually every credit-related decision in your financial life. Your credit score — the three-digit number lenders use to evaluate you — is calculated directly from the information in your credit report. If the report contains errors, your score may be artificially lower than it should be.

Here is what your credit report influences:

- **Loan approval and interest rates.** Lenders pull your credit report before approving any loan. The data in that report determines not just whether you are approved, but what interest rate you receive. Even a small difference in rate can cost thousands of dollars over the life of a mortgage or auto loan.
- **Rental applications.** Most landlords and property management companies run credit checks on prospective tenants. Negative items on your report can result in a denied application or a requirement for a larger security deposit.
- **Insurance premiums.** In many states, auto and homeowners insurance companies use credit-based insurance scores — derived from your credit report — to set premiums.
- **Employment and background checks.** Some employers, particularly in the financial sector, review credit reports as part of the hiring process. They cannot see your credit score, but they can see your report history.
- **Utility and cell phone accounts.** Utility companies and wireless carriers may check your credit when you open a new account. A poor report could mean a required deposit.

The takeaway is straightforward: if your credit report is inaccurate, you could be paying more than you should — or being denied opportunities you qualify for. Learning to read your report is the first step toward taking control.

## How to Get Your Credit Report

Before you can read your credit report, you need to get a copy. There is only one official source for free credit reports: [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/).

This site is authorized by federal law under the Fair Credit Reporting Act and is jointly operated by the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. Since 2020, all three bureaus have offered free weekly access to your credit report through this site, and that expanded access has been made permanent. You can check your full report from any or all three bureaus every week at no cost.

**How to request your reports:**

1. Go directly to [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). Type the URL manually rather than searching for it, to avoid phishing sites.
2. Fill in your personal information — name, address, Social Security number, and date of birth.
3. Select which bureau reports you want. Request all three, since each bureau may have slightly different data.
4. Answer identity verification questions (such as confirming a past address or a loan amount).
5. View or download your reports immediately.

<Callout type="warning" title="Never Pay for Your Credit Report">
If a website asks for a credit card number to show you a "free" report, it is likely a paid product or a free trial that converts to a subscription. **AnnualCreditReport.com is the only site you need, and it is genuinely free.**

## The Four Main Sections

Regardless of which bureau's report you are reading, the structure is similar. Every credit report is divided into four main sections:

1. **Personal Information** — Your identifying details
2. **Account History (Tradelines)** — Every credit account on your record
3. **Public Records** — Bankruptcies, civil judgments, and tax liens
4. **Inquiries** — Records of who has accessed your credit report

Each section serves a different purpose, and each has its own potential for errors. Let us walk through them one at a time.

## Section 1: Personal Information

This section contains your identifying information as reported by your creditors. It typically includes:

- **Full name** (and any variations creditors have used)
- **Current and previous addresses**
- **Social Security number** (usually partially masked)
- **Date of birth**
- **Current and previous employers**

### What to check

The personal information section does not directly affect your credit score, but errors here can signal bigger problems. Look for the following:

- **Names you do not recognize.** Aliases or name variations that are not yours could mean your file has been mixed with another person's — a more common error than you might expect, especially for people with common names.
- **Addresses you have never lived at.** An unfamiliar address is one of the earliest warning signs of identity theft. Someone may have opened an account in your name and used a different address to receive the mail.
- **Incorrect employer information.** While this does not affect your score, incorrect data suggests a creditor reported inaccurate information, which raises the question of what else they may have gotten wrong.

If anything in this section is unfamiliar or incorrect, take it seriously. It could be a simple data entry error, or it could be evidence of fraud.

## Section 2: Account History (Tradelines)

This is the largest and most important section of your credit report. Every credit account you have ever held — credit cards, mortgages, auto loans, student loans, personal loans, retail accounts, lines of credit — appears here as a "tradeline."

Each tradeline contains detailed information about the account:

- **Creditor name** — The lender or card issuer
- **Account number** — Partially masked for security
- **Account type** — Revolving (credit cards, lines of credit) or installment (fixed-payment loans)
- **Date opened** — When the account was established
- **Credit limit or original loan amount** — The maximum you were approved to borrow
- **Current balance** — How much you owe as of the last reporting date
- **Payment status** — Whether the account is current, past due, or in a negative status
- **Monthly payment history** — A month-by-month record typically going back 24 months or more

### Understanding Status Codes

Each tradeline includes a status code indicating the current condition of the account. Here are the most common ones:

- **Current / Pays as Agreed** — You are up to date on all payments. This is what you want to see.
- **30 Days Late** — Payment was received 30-59 days past the due date.
- **60 Days Late** — Payment was received 60-89 days past the due date.
- **90 Days Late** — Payment was 90-119 days past due. This is considered seriously delinquent.
- **120+ Days Late** — Severely delinquent. The creditor may be preparing to charge off the account.
- **Charge-Off** — The creditor wrote off the debt as a loss. This is one of the most damaging marks on a credit report.
- **Closed** — The account has been closed, either by you or the creditor. A closed account in good standing is positive; a closed account with missed payments remains negative.
- **Collection** — The debt was sold or transferred to a collections agency.

### Sample Tradeline Breakdown

Here is what a single tradeline might look like when broken down:

| Field | Example |
|---|---|
| Creditor | Chase Bank |
| Account Number | XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-4821 |
| Account Type | Revolving (Credit Card) |
| Date Opened | March 2019 |
| Credit Limit | $8,000 |
| Current Balance | $2,400 |
| Payment Status | Current |
| Highest Balance | $5,200 |
| Monthly Payment | $85 |
| Payment History (last 12 months) | OK-OK-OK-OK-OK-OK-OK-OK-OK-OK-OK-OK |

In the payment history row, "OK" means the payment was made on time. A late payment would appear as "30," "60," or "90" depending on how many days past due it was. A single "30" in a string of "OK" entries means one late payment was reported — enough to lower your score by 60 to 100 points or more, depending on your overall profile.

Review every tradeline carefully. Make sure you recognize every account, that the balances and limits are accurate, and that the payment history matches your records. This section is where the most consequential errors tend to appear.

## Section 3: Public Records

The public records section lists any financially relevant legal matters that are part of the public record. As of recent changes in credit reporting practices, the main item you will find here is:

- **Bankruptcies** — Chapter 7 bankruptcy stays on your report for 10 years from the filing date. Chapter 13 bankruptcy stays for 7 years.

Previously, civil judgments and tax liens also appeared in this section. However, the three major bureaus removed most civil judgments and tax liens from credit reports starting in 2018 due to data accuracy concerns. Some tax liens may still appear in limited circumstances, but for most consumers, bankruptcies are the only public record entries.

### Impact on Your Score

A bankruptcy is one of the most damaging items that can appear on a credit report. It can lower your score by 100 to 200 points or more and makes it significantly harder to qualify for new credit. However, its impact diminishes over time, and many consumers successfully [rebuild their credit](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score) within a few years of a bankruptcy filing.

If a public record appears on your report that you do not recognize or that contains incorrect information (wrong dates, wrong type of bankruptcy, or a bankruptcy that was dismissed rather than discharged), dispute it immediately.

## Section 4: Inquiries

The inquiries section shows a record of every entity that has accessed your credit report. There are two types, and the distinction between them matters:

<ComparisonRow title="Hard Inquiry vs. Soft Inquiry" options={[
  { title: "Hard Inquiry", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "Affects Score", value: "Yes (3-5 pts)" }, { label: "Stays on Report", value: "2 years" }, { label: "Triggered By", value: "Credit applications" }] },
  { title: "Soft Inquiry", variant: "green", recommended: true, stats: [{ label: "Affects Score", value: "No" }, { label: "Stays on Report", value: "Varies" }, { label: "Triggered By", value: "Pre-approvals, self-checks" }] }
]} />

### Hard Inquiries

A hard inquiry occurs when you apply for credit and the lender pulls your report to make a lending decision. Hard inquiries remain on your report for **2 years** and can lower your score by a few points each.

**Common examples of hard inquiries:**

- Applying for a credit card
- Applying for a mortgage, auto loan, or personal loan
- Requesting a credit limit increase (with some issuers)
- Applying for an apartment lease (some landlords)

**Rate shopping exception:** If you are shopping for a mortgage, auto loan, or student loan, multiple inquiries from the same type of lender within a 14-45 day window (depending on the scoring model) are typically counted as a single inquiry. This allows you to compare rates without being penalized for each application.

### Soft Inquiries

A soft inquiry occurs when your credit is checked for informational or non-lending purposes. Soft inquiries do **not** affect your credit score and are often only visible to you.

**Common examples of soft inquiries:**

- Checking your own credit report or score
- Pre-approval or pre-qualification offers from lenders
- Background checks by employers
- Account reviews by your existing creditors
- Insurance companies checking your credit-based insurance score

Review the hard inquiries section for any inquiries you do not recognize. An unfamiliar hard inquiry could mean someone applied for credit using your identity.

## How to Spot Errors

Now that you understand each section, here is a targeted checklist of the most common credit report errors and how to identify them:

| Error Type | What to Look For | Potential Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts that are not yours | Unfamiliar creditor names or account numbers | Could indicate identity theft; inflates total debt |
| Incorrect late payments | Late payments reported on months you paid on time | Directly lowers your score (payment history is 35% of FICO) |
| Wrong balances or credit limits | Balance or limit does not match your statements | Affects your credit utilization ratio, a major scoring factor |
| Duplicate accounts | Same debt listed more than once (common after collection transfers) | Artificially inflates your total outstanding debt |
| Incorrect personal information | Wrong name, address, or SSN | May indicate a mixed file or identity theft |
| Closed accounts showing as open | Account you closed still listed as active | May affect debt-to-income calculations |
| Incorrect dates | Wrong date opened, wrong date of last payment, or wrong delinquency date | Can extend how long negative items stay on your report |
| Accounts from identity theft | Accounts you never opened, addresses you never lived at | Severely damages your credit profile |

Take your time reviewing your report. Compare it against your own records — bank statements, payment receipts, loan documents. If something does not match, note it.

<Callout type="tip" title="Check All Three Bureaus">
Each bureau collects data independently — an error on one report may not appear on the others. Pull reports from **Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion** and compare them side by side for the most thorough review.

## What to Do If You Find an Error

If you discover an error on your credit report, you have the legal right to dispute it under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA). The credit bureau must investigate your dispute within 30 days and either verify the information, correct it, or remove it.

The dispute process involves filing with each bureau that shows the error, providing supporting documentation, and following up to confirm the correction was made. For a complete walkthrough of the dispute process — including bureau contact information, a dispute letter template, and what to do if your dispute is denied — see our full guide on [how to dispute errors on your credit report](/guides/how-to-dispute-credit-report-errors).

The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/) also provides tools, sample letters, and a complaint portal if you need to escalate.

## Understanding Your Report's Impact on Loan Options

Your credit report directly determines what lending options are available to you and what they cost. A clean report with on-time payment history and low utilization qualifies you for the best rates. Negative items, high balances, and errors can push you into higher-cost borrowing.

If you are trying to understand where you stand, start with our guide on [what is a good credit score](/guides/what-is-good-credit-score) to see how the ranges work and what lenders are looking for. If your credit is not where you want it to be, you still have options — many lenders work with borrowers across the credit spectrum, including those with [fair or poor credit](/loans/bad-credit).

Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to see how different credit scenarios affect your monthly payment and total borrowing cost. Even small improvements to your credit report can translate to meaningful savings.

## Next Steps

Reading your credit report is the first step. Acting on what you find is what makes the difference. Here is what to do from here:

- **If your report is clean:** Keep monitoring it regularly. Check one bureau every few months on a rotating basis to catch any changes early.
- **If you found errors:** File disputes with the relevant bureaus immediately. Our [dispute guide](/guides/how-to-dispute-credit-report-errors) walks you through the entire process.
- **If you want to improve your score:** Read our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free) to start tracking your progress, then take action based on what your report reveals.
