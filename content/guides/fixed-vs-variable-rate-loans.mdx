faqs:
  - question: "What is the difference between fixed and variable rate?"
    answer: "A fixed rate stays the same for the entire loan term — your monthly payment never changes. A variable rate can go up or down based on market conditions (tied to a benchmark like the prime rate). Variable rates often start lower but carry the risk of increasing over time."
  - question: "Which is more common for personal loans?"
    answer: "Most personal installment loans have fixed rates, which makes budgeting easier. Variable rates are more common with lines of credit, credit cards, and some mortgages. If you're comparing personal loan offers, they're almost always fixed rate."
  - question: "When would a variable rate be better?"
    answer: "A variable rate may be better when: you plan to pay off the loan quickly (before rates could rise significantly), current variable rates are substantially lower than fixed rates, you can afford higher payments if rates increase, or you're borrowing through a line of credit where you want flexibility."
  - question: "How high can a variable rate go?"
    answer: "Most variable rate loans have a rate cap (maximum rate) stated in the loan agreement. For personal lines of credit, caps are typically 18-29%. For adjustable-rate mortgages, caps limit increases per adjustment period (usually 2% per year) and over the life of the loan (usually 5-6% above the starting rate). Always check the cap before accepting."

Every loan comes with an interest rate, and that rate is either fixed or variable. This single distinction determines whether your monthly payment stays the same for the life of the loan or fluctuates with market conditions. Getting this decision right affects your budget, your total cost, and your financial peace of mind.

This guide explains how each rate type works, when each makes sense, and what to look for when comparing offers.

## Fixed Rate vs Variable Rate at a Glance

Before going deeper, here is a side-by-side comparison of the two rate types:

| Feature | Fixed Rate | Variable Rate |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **How rate is set** | Locked at signing based on credit profile and market conditions | Set as benchmark rate + lender margin; changes when benchmark changes |
| **Can it change?** | No — stays the same for the entire term | Yes — goes up or down with the benchmark rate |
| **Monthly payment stability** | Identical every month | Changes when the rate adjusts |
| **Starting rate (typically)** | Slightly higher than comparable variable rate | Often lower initially |
| **Risk level** | Lower — no surprises | Higher — payments can increase |
| **Best for** | Budget certainty, longer terms, rising-rate environments | Short repayment periods, falling-rate environments, risk-tolerant borrowers |
| **Common loan types** | Personal installment loans, auto loans, fixed-rate mortgages | Credit cards, HELOCs, adjustable-rate mortgages, personal lines of credit |

Neither type is universally better. The right choice depends on your financial situation, how long you plan to carry the debt, and how much payment variability you can absorb.

## How Fixed Rates Work

A fixed interest rate is set when you sign the loan agreement and never changes. If you borrow $3,000 at 15% fixed for 24 months, your monthly payment is $145.64 — every single month, from the first payment to the last. No exceptions, no adjustments, no surprises.

### Why Lenders Offer Fixed Rates

When a lender gives you a fixed rate, they are accepting the risk that market rates might rise during your loan term. If the broader market moves to 18% while you are locked in at 15%, the lender earns less than they could on a new loan. The lender compensates for this risk by setting fixed rates slightly higher than the initial variable rate they might otherwise offer.

### The Budgeting Advantage

The primary benefit of a fixed rate is predictability. When your payment is the same every month, you can build it into your budget with certainty. There is no scenario where an unexpected rate increase forces you to scramble for extra cash or cut other expenses. This matters especially for borrowers on tight or fixed incomes where even a $20 to $30 increase in a monthly payment can create strain.

### Example: Fixed Rate Payment Schedule

Consider a $3,000 personal loan at 15% fixed for 24 months:

- **Monthly payment:** $145.64 (every month, months 1 through 24)
- **Total interest paid:** $495.36
- **Total amount repaid:** $3,495.36

Month 1: $145.64. Month 12: $145.64. Month 24: $145.64. The amount never changes. You know exactly what you owe before the first payment is even due.

## How Variable Rates Work

A variable interest rate is tied to a **benchmark rate** — a publicly tracked interest rate that reflects broader market conditions. The most common benchmarks are:

- **Prime rate** — The rate banks charge their most creditworthy customers. Currently set by major banks based on the federal funds rate.
- **SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate)** — The successor to LIBOR, used as a benchmark for many consumer and commercial lending products.

Your variable rate is calculated as the benchmark rate plus a **margin** set by the lender. The margin is fixed and does not change — but the benchmark moves with the market. When the benchmark rises, your rate rises. When it falls, your rate falls.

### Example: How a Variable Rate Moves

Suppose your loan has a variable rate calculated as prime rate + 6% margin.

- **Starting rate:** Prime rate (8.50%) + 6.00% margin = **14.50%**
- **If prime rises to 9.50%:** 9.50% + 6.00% = **15.50%**
- **If prime rises to 10.00%:** 10.00% + 6.00% = **16.00%**
- **If prime falls to 7.50%:** 7.50% + 6.00% = **13.50%**

Each time the benchmark changes, your monthly payment recalculates based on the new rate. The timing and frequency of these adjustments vary by lender — some adjust monthly, others quarterly or annually.

### The Uncertainty Factor

The core challenge with a variable rate is that you cannot predict your future payments with certainty. Economic conditions, Federal Reserve policy decisions, and global financial events all influence benchmark rates. A rate that starts attractively low can climb substantially over the life of a multi-year loan.

## When to Choose a Fixed Rate

A fixed rate is the stronger choice in most of these scenarios:

- **You want budget certainty.** If knowing your exact payment amount every month is important to your financial planning, fixed is the clear choice. There is no guessing, no monitoring benchmark rates, no recalculating your budget.
- **Interest rates are rising or expected to rise.** When the Federal Reserve is raising rates or market conditions suggest rates will increase, locking in a fixed rate protects you from future increases. You pay the same rate regardless of what happens in the market after you sign.
- **You are taking a longer-term loan.** The longer the loan term, the more time there is for rates to move — and the more a variable rate can cost you. On a 36-month or 60-month loan, a lot can change in the rate environment. Fixed removes that uncertainty entirely.
- **You have limited financial flexibility.** If your budget is tight and a payment increase of $25 to $50 per month would cause real hardship, a fixed rate eliminates that possibility.

**The bottom line:** Most personal installment loans are fixed-rate by default, and for good reason. Fixed rates are the safer, more predictable option for the vast majority of borrowers.

## When to Choose a Variable Rate

A variable rate may be the better option in these specific situations:

- **Interest rates are falling or expected to fall.** If the Federal Reserve is cutting rates or economic conditions suggest rates will decline, a variable rate lets you benefit from those decreases without refinancing. Your rate drops automatically.
- **You plan to pay off the loan quickly.** If you are borrowing for six months or a year and plan to pay aggressively, rates may not have time to move significantly. The lower starting rate on a variable loan could save you money over that short window.
- **You are comfortable with some risk.** If a potential payment increase of 1-2% would not strain your finances, the lower initial rate of a variable loan may be worth the trade-off. This requires honest self-assessment of your financial cushion.
- **The starting rate is significantly lower than fixed alternatives.** If a variable rate starts at 10% while the best fixed rate available to you is 16%, the gap may be large enough to justify the risk — especially for shorter terms.
- **You are using a line of credit.** HELOCs and personal lines of credit are almost always variable-rate products. If a line of credit fits your needs (borrowing and repaying flexibly over time), a variable rate comes with the territory.

Variable rates are most common with credit cards, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and some adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs). Standard personal installment loans are rarely variable-rate.

## How Rate Changes Affect Your Payment

Understanding the abstract concept of rate changes is one thing. Seeing the dollar impact is another. Here is what a 2% rate increase looks like on a $5,000 loan with a 36-month term:

| Scenario | Interest Rate | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid | Total Repaid |
|----------|--------------|-----------------|---------------------|--------------|
| **Starting rate** | 12.00% | $166.07 | $978.52 | $5,978.52 |
| **After 2% increase** | 14.00% | $170.93 | $1,153.48 | $6,153.48 |
| **Difference** | +2.00% | **+$4.86/month** | **+$174.96** | **+$174.96** |

A 2% increase adds nearly $5 per month to your payment and costs an additional $175 over the life of the loan. On a $5,000 loan, that is meaningful but manageable. On a $25,000 loan, the same 2% increase adds approximately $25 per month and $875 in total interest. On a $200,000 mortgage, the numbers become dramatically larger.

The impact scales with the loan amount. The larger the balance and the longer the remaining term, the more a rate increase costs you.

## Caps and Floors

Most variable-rate loans include built-in protections that limit how much your rate can change. Understanding these limits is critical before accepting a variable-rate offer.

### Rate Caps

A **rate cap** sets the maximum your rate can reach. There are two types:

- **Periodic cap:** Limits how much the rate can increase in a single adjustment period. For example, a periodic cap of 2% means your rate cannot increase by more than 2 percentage points per adjustment (e.g., from 12% to no more than 14%).
- **Lifetime cap:** Limits the maximum rate over the entire life of the loan. For example, a lifetime cap of 5% above the starting rate means a loan that starts at 10% can never exceed 15%, regardless of how high benchmark rates climb.

### Rate Floors

A **rate floor** sets the minimum your rate can fall to. Even if the benchmark rate drops to near zero, your rate will not go below the floor. Most lenders set the floor at the margin rate (the lender's portion), meaning the benchmark component can drop to zero but you still pay the margin.

### What to Ask About Caps

Before accepting any variable-rate loan, ask the lender these specific questions:

- What is the periodic adjustment cap?
- What is the lifetime rate cap?
- What is the rate floor?
- How often does the rate adjust (monthly, quarterly, annually)?
- What benchmark rate is used, and where can I track it?

If the lender cannot answer these questions clearly, treat that as a red flag. Caps and adjustment terms should be explicitly stated in the loan agreement. The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) provides resources on understanding adjustable-rate terms and your rights as a borrower.

## Most Personal Loans Are Fixed Rate

If you are comparing personal loan offers — whether through FundingZest, a bank, a credit union, or an online lender — the offers you receive are almost certainly fixed-rate. This is the industry standard for personal installment loans.

This means:

- The rate you are quoted is the rate you will pay for the entire loan term
- Your monthly payment will be the same from the first month to the last
- You do not need to worry about benchmark rates, caps, floors, or payment adjustments

When you [compare offers on FundingZest](/apply), the rates shown are fixed. You can budget with confidence, knowing your payment will not change.

If you want to understand how the interest rate you are quoted translates to the actual cost of borrowing, our guide on [APR vs interest rate](/guides/apr-vs-interest-rate) explains the difference and why APR is the better comparison metric.

## How to Compare Fixed and Variable Offers

If you are in the rare situation of choosing between a fixed-rate and a variable-rate offer for the same loan, follow these steps:

1. **Compare the starting rates.** How much lower is the variable rate? If the gap is small (less than 1%), the savings may not justify the risk.
2. **Consider the loan term.** Shorter terms give variable rates less time to increase. Longer terms expose you to more rate risk.
3. **Check the rate cap.** What is the worst-case scenario for the variable rate? Calculate your payment at the maximum capped rate and ask yourself whether you could afford it.
4. **Assess the rate environment.** Are rates currently rising, falling, or stable? While no one can predict the future with certainty, the current direction of rates provides context.
5. **Calculate total cost under multiple scenarios.** Run the numbers for the variable rate staying the same, increasing by 2%, and hitting the cap. Compare each scenario to the fixed-rate total cost.

For most personal loan borrowers, fixed rate is the right default choice. Variable rate is a deliberate decision that requires understanding the risks and having the financial flexibility to absorb potential increases.
