  - question: "How long does a credit dispute take?"
    answer: "Under the Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), credit bureaus must investigate your dispute within 30 days (45 days if you submit additional information during the investigation). Most disputes are resolved within 30 days. Complex cases may take longer."
  - question: "Can I dispute items online?"
    answer: "Yes. All three bureaus accept online disputes: Equifax (equifax.com/personal/disputes), Experian (experian.com/disputes), TransUnion (transunion.com/credit-disputes). Online is fastest, but mailing a dispute letter creates a paper trail that may be preferable for complex disputes."
  - question: "What if the bureau doesn't fix the error?"
    answer: "If the bureau's investigation doesn't resolve the issue, you can: request the method of verification used, add a 100-word consumer statement to your report, escalate to the CFPB complaint portal, file a complaint with your state attorney general, or consult a consumer rights attorney about potential FCRA violations."
  - question: "Does disputing hurt my credit score?"
    answer: "No. Filing a dispute does not affect your credit score. If the dispute results in a negative item being removed or corrected, your score will typically improve. The disputed item may be temporarily marked as 'in dispute' during investigation."
  - question: "Can I dispute accurate negative information?"
    answer: "You can dispute any information you believe is inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable. However, you cannot have accurate information removed simply because it's negative. Legitimate late payments, collections, and bankruptcies will remain for their full reporting period (typically 7-10 years)."

Errors on credit reports are not rare exceptions — they are a widespread problem that affects millions of Americans. A landmark study by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) found that approximately [1 in 4 consumers identified errors on their credit reports](https://www.ftc.gov/consumer-advice/money-and-credit/credit-and-loans) that could affect their credit scores. Some errors are minor, like a misspelled name. Others are severe — accounts that do not belong to you, incorrect late payments, or balances that are flat-out wrong. These mistakes can cost you real money in the form of higher interest rates, denied loan applications, and lost opportunities.

The good news is that you have strong legal protections. The [Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act) gives you the right to dispute any information on your credit report that you believe is inaccurate, incomplete, or unverifiable. Credit bureaus are required by law to investigate your dispute and correct verified errors. This guide walks you through the entire process, from identifying errors to getting them fixed.

## Why Disputing Errors Matters

Credit report errors are not just an inconvenience. They have direct financial consequences.

**Higher interest rates.** If an error is lowering your credit score, you will pay more for every loan you take out. On a 30-year mortgage, even a half-percentage-point difference in interest rate can add up to tens of thousands of dollars in extra payments.

**Loan denials.** Errors that push your score below a lender's minimum threshold can result in outright denial. You might be creditworthy, but if your report says otherwise, the lender will not approve you.

**Rental and employment rejections.** Landlords and some employers review credit reports. Errors that show collection accounts, high balances, or delinquencies that are not actually yours can cost you an apartment or a job offer.

**Lost time and frustration.** Discovering an error at the moment you are applying for a mortgage or car loan creates delays and stress. Catching and fixing errors proactively — before you need credit — gives you the cleanest report possible when it matters most.

You have the legal right to a fair and accurate credit report. Exercising that right starts with knowing how to identify errors and file effective disputes.

## Common Credit Report Errors

Before you can dispute an error, you need to know what you are looking for. Here are the most common types of credit report errors:

| Error Type | Description | How Common |
|---|---|---|
| Accounts that are not yours | An account you never opened appears on your report | Common, especially with identity theft or mixed files |
| Incorrect payment status | A payment reported as late that was actually made on time | Very common — one of the most frequent dispute reasons |
| Wrong balance or credit limit | The reported balance or limit does not match your actual account | Common, often due to reporting delays or data errors |
| Duplicate accounts | The same debt appears more than once (frequent after collection transfers) | Moderately common |
| Accounts from identity theft | Fraudulently opened accounts appearing on your report | Increasing — identity theft affects millions annually |
| Incorrect personal information | Wrong name, address, SSN, or date of birth | Very common but usually low impact on score |
| Closed accounts showing as open | An account you closed is still listed as active | Moderately common |
| Incorrect dates | Wrong date opened, wrong delinquency date, or wrong date of last activity | Common, and can extend how long negative items stay on your report |
| Wrong account status | An account marked as in collections when it has been paid, or a discharged bankruptcy debt still showing a balance | Moderately common |

Any of these errors can affect your credit score, your ability to get approved for credit, and the interest rates you are offered.

## Step 1: Get Your Credit Reports

You cannot dispute what you cannot see. Start by requesting your credit reports from all three major bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — through [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). This is the only site authorized by federal law to provide free credit reports, and all three bureaus now offer free weekly access.

**Request reports from all three bureaus.** Creditors do not always report to every bureau, so an error might appear on one report but not the others. Conversely, the same error might appear on all three. You need to check each one and file separate disputes with each bureau that has the error.

Compare the three reports side by side. Look for inconsistencies between them. An account that appears on one report but not the others could be legitimate (not all creditors report to all bureaus), or it could indicate an error or fraud.

For a detailed walkthrough of how to access and review your reports, see our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free).

## Step 2: Identify and Document Errors

Go through each report section by section — personal information, account history, public records, and inquiries. For each error you find:

**Mark it clearly.** If you printed your report, circle or highlight the error. If you are working digitally, create a list noting the bureau, the account name, the account number, and the specific incorrect information.

**Describe the correction needed.** For each error, write a clear statement of what is wrong and what the correct information should be. For example: "This account shows a 30-day late payment in September 2025. My bank records confirm the payment was received on time on September 12, 2025."

**Gather supporting documentation.** This is the most important step. Your dispute is far more likely to succeed if you include evidence. Depending on the type of error, gather:

- **Bank statements** showing payments were made on time
- **Payment receipts or confirmation emails** from the creditor
- **Written correspondence** with the creditor about the account
- **Identity theft reports** filed with the FTC (if applicable)
- **Court documents** showing a bankruptcy was dismissed or discharged
- **Account closure confirmations** for accounts that should show as closed
- **Pay-off letters** from creditors or collectors for debts that have been satisfied

Make copies of everything. Never send original documents — always send photocopies with your dispute. Keep a complete copy of your dispute file for your own records.

## Step 3: File Your Dispute

You have three methods for filing a dispute with each bureau. Each has its advantages.

### Online Disputes (Fastest)

Each bureau has an online dispute portal:

- **Equifax:** equifax.com/personal/disputes
- **Experian:** experian.com/disputes
- **TransUnion:** transunion.com/credit-disputes

Online disputes are typically the fastest method. You can usually upload supporting documents, and the process is guided step by step. Most consumers receive a response within 2-3 weeks.

### Mail Disputes (Best Paper Trail)

Sending a dispute letter by certified mail with return receipt requested creates the strongest paper trail. This is recommended for complex disputes or situations where you may need to escalate later. Mail your dispute to:

- **Equifax:** P.O. Box 740256, Atlanta, GA 30374-0256
- **Experian:** P.O. Box 4500, Allen, TX 75013
- **TransUnion:** P.O. Box 2000, Chester, PA 19016

### Phone Disputes (Least Effective)

You can call each bureau to initiate a dispute, but phone disputes are the least effective method. There is no written record of exactly what you said, and it is harder to provide supporting documentation. If you do call, follow up with a written confirmation.

- **Equifax:** 1-866-349-5191
- **Experian:** 1-888-397-3742
- **TransUnion:** 1-800-916-8800

### What to Include in Your Dispute

Whether filing online or by mail, include the following:

- Your full name, address, and date of birth
- Your Social Security number (for identification)
- The specific item or items you are disputing (include account name and number)
- A clear explanation of why the information is wrong
- The specific correction you are requesting
- Copies of supporting documentation
- A request for the bureau to send you the corrected report once the investigation is complete

### Sample Dispute Letter Format

If you are filing by mail, structure your letter like this:

**Your Name**
**Your Address**
**Your City, State, ZIP**
**Date**

**Credit Bureau Name**
**Bureau Dispute Address**

**Re: Dispute of Inaccurate Information — Report Number [your report number]**

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to dispute the following inaccurate information on my credit report. The item(s) I am disputing are identified below.

**Account Name:** [Creditor Name]
**Account Number:** [Account Number]
**Reason for Dispute:** [Clear description of the error]
**Requested Correction:** [What the correct information should be]

I have enclosed copies of [describe documentation] supporting my dispute. Please investigate this matter, correct the disputed item, and send me an updated copy of my credit report reflecting the correction.

Sincerely,
[Your Signature]
[Your Printed Name]

**Enclosures:** [List each document you are including]

**File your dispute with every bureau that shows the error.** Correcting an error on your Equifax report does not automatically fix the same error on your Experian or TransUnion reports. You must file separately with each.

## Step 4: Wait for the Investigation

Once you file your dispute, the bureau is legally required to investigate under the FCRA. Here is what happens during the investigation:

1. **The bureau reviews your dispute** and forwards it to the furnisher — the creditor or company that originally reported the information.
2. **The furnisher investigates** the claim by reviewing their own records.
3. **The furnisher responds** to the bureau, either verifying the original information, agreeing that it was inaccurate, or reporting that they cannot verify it.
4. **The bureau updates your report** based on the furnisher's response.

The entire process must be completed within **30 days** of the bureau receiving your dispute. If you submit additional supporting information during the investigation, the window extends to **45 days**. The clock starts when the bureau receives your dispute, not when you send it.

During the investigation, the disputed item may be temporarily marked as "in dispute" on your report. This notation does not affect your credit score.

## Step 5: Review the Results

After the investigation, the bureau must send you the results in writing. This will include:

- **A notice of the outcome** — whether the item was verified as accurate, corrected, or deleted
- **A free copy of your updated credit report** if any changes were made
- **The name, address, and phone number of the furnisher** if the item was verified as accurate

Review the updated report carefully. Confirm that the correction was actually made and that no new errors were introduced. If the error appeared on reports from multiple bureaus, check each one separately.

## If the Dispute Is Denied

Sometimes bureaus or furnishers verify information that you know is wrong. If your dispute is denied and you still believe the information is inaccurate, you have several options:

**Request the method of verification.** Under the FCRA, you have the right to know how the bureau verified the disputed information. Send a written request asking for the specific documents or process used to verify the item. This can reveal whether the investigation was thorough or merely rubber-stamped.

**Add a consumer statement.** You can add a brief statement (up to 100 words) to your credit report explaining your side of the dispute. This statement becomes part of your report and is visible to anyone who pulls it. While it does not change your score, it provides context to future lenders.

**File a complaint with the CFPB.** The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau complaint portal](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) allows you to file a formal complaint against the credit bureau or the furnisher. CFPB complaints often receive faster and more thorough attention than standard disputes because companies are required to respond.

**Contact your state attorney general.** Your state attorney general's office handles consumer protection complaints and may be able to intervene on your behalf, particularly if there is a pattern of violations.

**Consult an FCRA attorney.** If the error is causing significant financial harm and the bureau or furnisher refuses to correct it, a consumer rights attorney specializing in FCRA violations can advise you on legal options. Many FCRA attorneys offer free consultations and work on contingency, meaning you pay nothing unless they win your case. The FCRA provides for statutory damages of $100 to $1,000 per violation, plus actual damages and attorney fees.

## Disputing Directly with the Furnisher

In addition to disputing with the credit bureaus, you have the right to dispute directly with the furnisher — the creditor or company that reported the inaccurate information. Under the FCRA, furnishers have an independent obligation to investigate disputes and correct errors.

To dispute with a furnisher, send a written dispute letter to the creditor's address (check your billing statement or the creditor's website for their dispute address). Include the same information and documentation you would include in a bureau dispute. The furnisher has **30 days** to investigate after receiving your dispute.

Disputing with the furnisher can be effective because the furnisher has direct access to your account records. If the furnisher agrees that the information is wrong, they must notify all three credit bureaus to correct it — potentially fixing the error across all your reports with a single dispute.

For best results, dispute with both the credit bureau and the furnisher simultaneously. This creates two parallel investigations and increases your chances of a favorable outcome.

## How to Prevent Future Errors

Disputing errors is important, but prevention saves you time and stress. Here are steps you can take to minimize the chances of errors appearing on your reports in the future:

**Monitor your credit reports regularly.** With free weekly access through [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/), there is no reason not to check your reports periodically. Consider checking one bureau every few months on a rotating schedule.

**Set up credit monitoring alerts.** Free services like Credit Karma and Experian's free account will notify you when new accounts are opened, balances change significantly, or new inquiries appear on your report. These alerts help you catch problems early.

**Place a fraud alert or credit freeze.** If you have been a victim of identity theft or are concerned about fraud, you can place a free fraud alert (lasts one year) or a free credit freeze (lasts until you lift it) with each bureau. A fraud alert requires creditors to take extra verification steps before opening new accounts. A credit freeze prevents anyone — including you — from opening new credit accounts until the freeze is lifted. Learn more from the [CFPB's credit report and score tools](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/).

**Keep your own records.** Save payment confirmations, loan statements, and correspondence with creditors. Having documentation readily available makes the dispute process faster and more effective if you ever need it.

## Your Rights Under the FCRA

The [Fair Credit Reporting Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-credit-reporting-act) is the federal law that governs how credit bureaus collect, use, and share your information. Key protections include:

- **The right to a free annual credit report** from each bureau (now available weekly)
- **The right to dispute inaccurate information** and have it investigated within 30 days
- **The right to know who has accessed your report** through the inquiries section
- **The right to have outdated negative information removed** (most items after 7 years, bankruptcy after 7-10 years)
- **The right to sue** credit bureaus or furnishers that violate the FCRA
- **The right to place fraud alerts and credit freezes** at no cost
- **The right to be notified** if information in your credit file has been used against you in a lending or employment decision

These rights exist regardless of your credit score, income level, or financial situation. They apply equally to every consumer.

## Next Steps

A clean credit report is the foundation for a strong financial profile. Whether you are preparing to [apply for a loan](/apply), working to [improve your credit score](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score), or simply taking control of your financial health, making sure your credit report is accurate is where it starts.

If your credit is not where you want it to be — even after correcting errors — you still have options. Many lenders work with borrowers across the credit spectrum, including those with [fair or poor credit](/loans/bad-credit). Comparing offers from multiple lenders ensures you find the best available rate for your situation.
