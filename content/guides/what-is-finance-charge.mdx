faqs:
  - question: "What is a finance charge?"
    answer: "A finance charge is the total cost of borrowing money, expressed as a dollar amount. It includes all interest charges plus certain mandatory fees (origination fees, service charges, transaction fees). The finance charge tells you the exact dollar cost of the loan, while APR expresses that cost as an annual percentage."
  - question: "Is finance charge the same as interest?"
    answer: "Not exactly. Interest is one component of the finance charge. The finance charge includes interest PLUS certain fees (origination, service charges, etc.). For a loan with no fees, the finance charge equals the total interest. For a loan with fees, the finance charge is higher than the interest alone."
  - question: "How do I find the finance charge on my loan?"
    answer: "Lenders are required to disclose the finance charge on your Truth in Lending (TILA) disclosure, which you receive before signing the loan agreement. It's typically labeled as 'Finance Charge' and shows the total dollar cost of the loan over its full term."
  - question: "Can I reduce the finance charge?"
    answer: "Yes. You can reduce the finance charge by: getting a lower APR (shop around), choosing a shorter term (less time for interest to accrue), making extra payments (reduces principal faster), choosing a lender with lower fees, or improving your credit score before borrowing."

## What Is a Finance Charge?

A finance charge is the total dollar cost of borrowing money. It represents every cent you pay above and beyond the original amount you borrowed — including interest, origination fees, and other mandatory charges imposed by the lender.

Think of it this way: if you borrow $3,000 and repay $3,450 over the life of the loan, your finance charge is $450. That $450 is the price you paid for the privilege of borrowing.

The finance charge is one of the most important numbers on any loan disclosure because it tells you, in plain dollars, exactly what the loan costs. While the APR expresses cost as an annual percentage (useful for comparing loans), the finance charge gives you the concrete figure — the actual money leaving your pocket.

Under the federal [Truth in Lending Act (TILA)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/), every lender in the United States is required to disclose the finance charge before you sign a loan agreement. This disclosure is not optional. If a lender cannot or will not tell you the finance charge, that is a serious red flag.

## What's Included in a Finance Charge

The finance charge is not just interest. It encompasses several categories of borrowing costs that the lender is required to bundle into one figure.

### Costs Included in the Finance Charge

- **Interest charges** — The percentage-based cost applied to your outstanding principal over the life of the loan. This is typically the largest component.
- **Origination fees** — A one-time fee some lenders charge for processing and funding the loan, usually 1% to 8% of the loan amount.
- **Service charges** — Monthly or periodic fees some lenders charge for account maintenance or servicing.
- **Transaction fees** — Fees tied to how the loan is funded or how payments are processed (for example, wire transfer fees).
- **Credit insurance premiums** — If the lender requires you to purchase credit insurance as a condition of the loan, those premiums are part of the finance charge.

### Costs NOT Included in the Finance Charge

- **Late fees** — Charged only if you miss a payment. Since they are conditional, they are excluded.
- **Returned payment (NSF) fees** — Triggered only if a payment bounces. Also conditional.
- **Optional services** — Add-on products like payment protection plans that you voluntarily choose.
- **Application fees** — In some cases, application fees are excluded from the finance charge, though this varies by lender and loan type.

Understanding what is and is not included helps you evaluate the total cost of a loan more accurately. Always ask the lender for a full breakdown of all charges — both those inside and outside the finance charge — before you commit.

## Finance Charge vs APR vs Interest Rate

These three terms are related but measure different things. Confusing them is one of the most common mistakes borrowers make.

| | Finance Charge | APR | Interest Rate |
|---|---|---|---|
| **What it measures** | Total dollar cost of borrowing | Annual percentage cost of borrowing | Annual percentage charged on principal |
| **What it includes** | Interest + mandatory fees | Interest + mandatory fees | Interest only |
| **Format** | Dollar amount ($) | Percentage (%) | Percentage (%) |
| **Best for** | Knowing the exact cost of this specific loan | Comparing loans of different amounts and terms | Understanding the base rate before fees |
| **Example ($3,000 loan, 12 months)** | $450 | 28% | 24% |

**The key distinction:** The interest rate tells you the base cost of borrowing. The APR folds in fees and expresses the total cost as an annual percentage. The finance charge tells you the total cost in actual dollars.

When you are comparing two loans of the same amount and term, the finance charge gives you the most direct answer: "This loan costs $450 and that one costs $620." When you are comparing loans with different amounts or terms, APR is the better tool because it standardizes the cost into a common unit.

For a deeper explanation of how APR works and how to use it for comparisons, read our guide on [understanding APR on small-dollar loans](/guides/understanding-apr-small-dollar-loans). For a step-by-step comparison framework, see [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers).

## How Finance Charges Are Calculated

For installment loans with fixed payments, the finance charge is determined by three variables: the **principal** (amount borrowed), the **APR**, and the **term** (repayment period). A higher APR, a larger principal, or a longer term all increase the finance charge.

Here is what the finance charge looks like for a **$1,000 loan** repaid over **12 months** at three different APR levels:

| APR | Monthly Payment | Total Repaid | Finance Charge |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12% | $89 | $1,066 | $66 |
| 24% | $94 | $1,135 | $135 |
| 36% | $100 | $1,206 | $206 |

At 12% APR, borrowing $1,000 for a year costs $66. At 36% APR, the same loan costs $206 — more than three times as much. The monthly payment difference is only $11, but the finance charge difference is $140.

Now consider the same APRs applied to a **$5,000 loan** over **24 months**:

| APR | Monthly Payment | Total Repaid | Finance Charge |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12% | $235 | $5,641 | $641 |
| 24% | $264 | $6,340 | $1,340 |
| 36% | $296 | $7,094 | $2,094 |

At larger amounts and longer terms, the finance charge grows substantially. The difference between 12% and 36% APR on a $5,000 loan over 24 months is $1,453 — a significant sum for most borrowers.

## Finance Charges on Different Products

Finance charges apply to virtually every form of borrowing, but they work differently depending on the product type.

| Product | Finance Charge Structure | Predictability | Typical Range (per $1,000 borrowed) |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Installment loans** | Fixed, calculated at origination based on APR and term | High — known upfront | $30 – $400+ depending on APR and term |
| **Credit cards** | Variable, based on revolving balance and payment behavior | Low — changes monthly | Depends entirely on balance carried and payments made |
| **Payday loans** | Flat fee per amount borrowed (e.g., $15 per $100) | High for single use, low if rolled over | $150 – $300 per $1,000 per pay cycle |
| **Lines of credit** | Based on drawn amount, not credit limit | Medium — depends on usage | Varies with draw amount and repayment speed |

**Installment loans** offer the most predictable finance charges. Because the rate, term, and payment amount are fixed at signing, you know the exact finance charge before you borrow. This is one of the key advantages of [installment loans](/guides/how-installment-loans-work) over revolving or lump-sum products.

**Credit cards** have unpredictable finance charges because they depend on your balance, payment timing, and whether you carry a balance month to month. Paying your full statement balance each month results in zero finance charges. Carrying a balance means finance charges accrue daily.

**Payday loans** have a simple finance charge structure — typically $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed. However, if you roll over the loan, a new finance charge is added each cycle. Three rollovers on a $500 payday loan at $15 per $100 turns a $75 finance charge into $300.

## How to Minimize Your Finance Charge

Every dollar you save on the finance charge is a dollar that stays in your pocket. Here are five strategies that work.

**Get a lower APR.** This is the single most effective way to reduce your finance charge. Shop around — compare at least three to five offers. Even a few percentage points can save you hundreds of dollars. Use [FundingZest](/apply) to see pre-qualified offers from multiple lenders with one application.

**Choose a shorter term.** A shorter repayment period means less time for interest to accrue. The monthly payment will be higher, but the finance charge will be significantly lower. Choose the shortest term you can comfortably afford.

**Make extra payments.** Any payment above your scheduled amount goes directly toward reducing the principal. A smaller principal means less interest accrues in future months, which lowers the total finance charge. Even an extra $25 or $50 per month makes a meaningful difference. Confirm your lender does not charge a [prepayment penalty](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers) before making extra payments.

**Choose a lender with lower fees.** Origination fees, service charges, and processing fees all increase the finance charge. Some lenders charge no origination fee at all. Compare the full fee structure, not just the interest rate.

**Improve your credit score before borrowing.** A higher credit score qualifies you for lower APRs, which directly reduces the finance charge. If your need is not urgent, spending a few months [improving your credit score](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score) before applying can save you real money.

## Your Right to Know

The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) gives you the legal right to see the finance charge before you agree to any loan. Lenders must provide a standardized disclosure document — often called the TILA disclosure or the "Schumer Box" for credit cards — that includes the finance charge in a clearly labeled format.

On the standard TILA disclosure for installment loans, the finance charge appears in **Box 4** (labeled "Finance Charge"). It shows the total dollar amount the loan will cost you over its full term, assuming you make every payment on schedule and do not pay early or late.

### How to Read Your TILA Disclosure

The disclosure includes four key figures:

1. **Amount Financed** — The net amount of credit provided to you (loan amount minus any prepaid finance charges like origination fees).
2. **Finance Charge** — The total dollar cost of borrowing over the full loan term.
3. **Total of Payments** — The total amount you will have paid when the loan is complete (amount financed + finance charge).
4. **APR** — The annual cost of credit expressed as a percentage.

Review all four numbers. If the finance charge or total of payments seems higher than you expected, ask the lender to explain every component before you sign. You are not obligated to accept any offer, and walking away from a loan with unexpectedly high costs is always the right decision.

## Calculate Your Finance Charge

The best way to understand the finance charge on any loan you are considering is to calculate it before you apply. Our [loan calculator](/calculator) lets you enter your loan amount, estimated APR, and desired term to see the estimated finance charge, monthly payment, and total repayment amount.

Understanding the finance charge puts you in control. When you know exactly what a loan costs in real dollars — not just percentages — you make better borrowing decisions.
