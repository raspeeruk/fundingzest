  - question: "What is the CFPB?"
    answer: "The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) is a federal agency created in 2010 to protect consumers in the financial marketplace. It regulates banks, credit unions, payday lenders, mortgage companies, and other financial service providers. The CFPB writes and enforces rules, handles consumer complaints, and takes enforcement action against companies that break the law."
  - question: "Does the CFPB cap payday loan interest rates?"
    answer: "No. The CFPB does not set maximum interest rates — that's left to individual states. The CFPB's rules focus on lending practices: disclosure requirements, payment withdrawal protections, and preventing unfair or deceptive practices. The Military Lending Act (enforced by the Department of Defense, not CFPB) caps rates at 36% for active duty military."
  - question: "What protections does the CFPB provide for payday loan borrowers?"
    answer: "Key CFPB protections include: mandatory disclosure of all loan costs before signing, limits on unauthorized bank account debits, complaint resolution processes, enforcement against deceptive practices, and resources for understanding your rights. The CFPB also maintains a public complaint database and takes legal action against violating lenders."
  - question: "Can I file a complaint with the CFPB about a payday lender?"
    answer: "Yes. You can file a complaint at consumerfinance.gov/complaint. The CFPB forwards your complaint to the company, which must respond within 15 days. The CFPB tracks complaints and uses them to identify companies engaging in harmful practices. In 2023, payday lending was among the top complaint categories."
  - question: "Has the CFPB's payday lending rule changed recently?"
    answer: "The CFPB's payday lending regulations have undergone several changes. The original 2017 rule included mandatory underwriting requirements (ability-to-repay checks). Parts of this rule were later revised, and the regulatory landscape continues to evolve. The payment provisions requiring lenders to notify borrowers before debiting accounts remain in effect."

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau plays a central role in how payday lending operates in the United States. Whether you are considering a short-term loan or trying to understand your rights after borrowing, knowing what the CFPB does — and what it does not do — is essential. Federal regulation sets a baseline of protections that apply regardless of where you live, but it does not replace the state laws that govern interest rates, loan amounts, and lending practices in your specific location.

This guide explains the CFPB's authority over payday lending, the history of its payday lending rules, the protections currently in effect, and how to use CFPB resources if you believe a lender has treated you unfairly.

## What Is the CFPB?

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is an independent federal agency established in 2010 under the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act. Congress created the CFPB in response to the 2008 financial crisis, consolidating consumer protection responsibilities that had been scattered across seven different federal agencies into a single entity with a focused mandate: protect consumers in the financial marketplace.

The CFPB oversees a broad range of financial service providers, including banks, credit unions, mortgage companies, debt collectors, credit reporting agencies, and payday lenders. Its authority covers any entity that offers or provides consumer financial products or services.

**The CFPB's core powers include:**

- **Rulemaking:** Writing and implementing regulations that govern how financial products are offered and managed
- **Supervision:** Examining financial institutions to ensure compliance with federal consumer financial law
- **Enforcement:** Taking legal action against companies that violate consumer protection laws, resulting in fines, restitution to harmed consumers, and operational restrictions
- **Complaint handling:** Operating a public complaint system where consumers can report problems with financial products and services
- **Consumer education:** Providing tools, guides, and resources to help consumers make informed financial decisions

For payday loan borrowers specifically, the CFPB is the primary federal regulator. While individual states set the interest rate caps and licensing requirements that govern [payday lending](/loans/payday) within their borders, the CFPB establishes and enforces the federal rules that apply to every payday lender operating in the country.

## History of CFPB Payday Lending Rules

The CFPB's approach to payday lending regulation has evolved significantly since the agency's creation. Understanding this history provides important context for where the rules stand today.

### Timeline of Key Events

**2012 -- CFPB begins payday lending oversight.** The CFPB starts supervising payday lenders, marking the first time a federal agency directly oversaw the short-term lending industry. Prior to this, payday lending was regulated almost exclusively at the state level.

**2013-2016 -- Research and rulemaking process.** The CFPB conducts extensive research into payday lending practices, including studies on rollover rates, borrower outcomes, and the impact of repeated borrowing. <StatHighlight value="80%" label="of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days, per CFPB research" icon="warning" variant="red" />

The research also finds that a significant portion of borrowers end up paying more in fees than the amount they originally borrowed.

**2017 -- Final payday lending rule issued.** In October 2017, the CFPB issues its comprehensive payday lending rule, officially titled "Payday, Vehicle Title, and Certain High-Cost Installment Loans." This rule contained two major components:

- **Mandatory Underwriting Provisions:** Required lenders to conduct a "full-payment test" — verifying that the borrower could afford to repay the loan and still meet basic living expenses and major financial obligations. This ability-to-repay requirement would have fundamentally changed the payday lending business model.
- **Payment Provisions:** Required lenders to provide written notice before attempting to debit a borrower's bank account, and imposed limits on repeated debit attempts after two consecutive failed withdrawals.

The original compliance date was set for August 2019.

**2019 -- Compliance deadline delayed.** The CFPB proposes rescinding the mandatory underwriting provisions and delays the compliance deadline while the rulemaking process continues. The payment provisions are also delayed.

**2020 -- Underwriting provisions rescinded.** In July 2020, the CFPB finalizes the revocation of the mandatory underwriting provisions (the ability-to-repay requirement). The agency concludes that it lacks sufficient evidence that the absence of ability-to-repay requirements constitutes an unfair or abusive practice. The payment provisions, however, remain intact.

**2022 -- Payment provisions take effect.** After multiple delays, the payment provisions of the 2017 rule become enforceable. Lenders must now provide advance notice before debiting borrower bank accounts and must comply with limits on repeated debit attempts.

**Ongoing -- Enforcement actions continue.** The CFPB continues taking enforcement actions against individual payday lenders for violations of existing federal consumer protection laws, including the Truth in Lending Act, the Electronic Fund Transfer Act, and prohibitions against unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts and practices (UDAAP).

## Current CFPB Protections for Payday Borrowers

The protections currently in effect fall into four categories: payment provisions, disclosure requirements, unfair and deceptive practice prohibitions, and the complaint process.

### Payment Provisions

The payment provisions are the surviving component of the CFPB's 2017 payday lending rule. They address one of the most common problems payday borrowers face: lenders making repeated attempts to withdraw money from bank accounts, triggering overdraft fees and non-sufficient funds (NSF) charges even when the borrower cannot afford the payment.

**What the payment provisions require:**

- **Advance notice of payment attempts.** Before a lender debits your bank account, they must provide you with written notice specifying the date, amount, and payment channel. This notice must be sent at least three business days before the first payment attempt and at least three business days before any payment that differs from the previous attempt in date, amount, or channel.
- **Limits on consecutive failed withdrawal attempts.** After two consecutive unsuccessful attempts to debit a borrower's account, the lender cannot make a third attempt without obtaining new, specific authorization from the borrower. This prevents the cascading bank fees that occur when lenders repeatedly try to withdraw funds from an account with insufficient balance.
- **Protection against excessive bank fees.** By limiting failed withdrawal attempts, these rules directly reduce the overdraft and NSF fees that borrowers incur from their own banks — fees that often exceed the payday loan fee itself.

These protections apply to payday loans, vehicle title loans, and certain high-cost installment loans with terms of 45 days or less.

### Disclosure Requirements

Federal law — specifically the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) — requires all consumer lenders, including payday lenders, to provide standardized disclosures before a borrower signs a loan agreement. The CFPB enforces these requirements for payday lenders.

**Required disclosures include:**

- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR):** The annualized cost of borrowing, which allows comparison across different loan types and terms
- **Finance charge:** The total dollar cost of the loan, including all interest and fees
- **Total of payments:** The full amount the borrower will pay over the life of the loan (principal plus finance charge)
- **Payment schedule:** When payments are due and how much each payment will be

<Callout type="warning" title="Missing Disclosures = Federal Violation">
These disclosures must be provided **in writing** before you sign the loan agreement. They cannot be provided only verbally, and they cannot be buried in fine print. If a lender fails to provide TILA disclosures — APR, finance charge, total of payments, and payment schedule — they are violating federal law. **Do not proceed with the loan.**
</Callout>

### Unfair, Deceptive, or Abusive Acts and Practices (UDAAP)

Beyond specific payday lending rules, the CFPB has broad authority to take action against any financial company that engages in unfair, deceptive, or abusive acts or practices. This UDAAP authority is one of the CFPB's most powerful tools for protecting payday loan borrowers.

**Practices the CFPB can target under UDAAP include:**

- **Hidden fees:** Charging fees that were not disclosed in the loan agreement or that were obscured in the fine print
- **Misleading advertising:** Promoting loan terms that don't match the actual offer, using deceptive language about costs or approval likelihood, or implying government affiliation
- **Deceptive collection practices:** Threatening borrowers with arrest, contacting employers without authorization, misrepresenting the amount owed, or harassing borrowers through excessive calls
- **Unauthorized account debits:** Withdrawing money from a borrower's bank account without proper authorization or in violation of the payment provisions described above
- **Deceptive refinancing:** Pressuring borrowers to roll over loans without clearly disclosing the additional cost, or structuring refinancing in a way that misleads borrowers about their total obligation

UDAAP authority allows the CFPB to pursue individual lenders for practices that are harmful to consumers even when no specific regulation has been written to address that exact practice. This provides a flexible enforcement tool that adapts to evolving lending tactics.

### Complaint Process

The CFPB operates a free, public complaint system that gives borrowers a formal channel to report problems with payday lenders. This system serves a dual purpose: it helps individual borrowers get responses from companies, and it provides the CFPB with data to identify systemic problems and enforcement targets.

**How the complaint process works:**

1. **Submit your complaint** at [consumerfinance.gov/complaint](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/). Include details about the lender, the product, and the specific problem.
2. **The CFPB forwards your complaint** to the company and asks them to respond.
3. **The company must respond** within 15 days (or indicate that a response is in progress, with a final response due within 60 days).
4. **You can review the response** and indicate whether you're satisfied with it.
5. **The CFPB tracks all complaints** in a public database that consumers, researchers, and regulators can access.

Filing a complaint does not guarantee a resolution in your favor, but it creates an official record that the CFPB uses to identify patterns of harmful behavior. When a company accumulates a significant volume of complaints about similar issues, it increases the likelihood of CFPB supervisory or enforcement action.

## CFPB Enforcement Actions

The CFPB has taken enforcement action against numerous payday lenders since its creation, resulting in hundreds of millions of dollars in penalties and restitution. While specific cases involve individual companies, the types of violations the CFPB has pursued illustrate what federal regulation actually prevents.

**Common violations in CFPB enforcement actions include:**

- **Deceptive loan cost disclosures:** Lenders advertising one set of terms and delivering another, or failing to disclose the full cost of borrowing before the consumer commits
- **Unauthorized bank account debits:** Withdrawing funds from borrower accounts without proper authorization, or continuing to debit accounts after authorization has been revoked
- **Illegal collection practices:** Using threats, harassment, and deception to collect on payday loans — including threats of arrest, which have no legal basis for civil debt
- **Charging undisclosed fees:** Adding fees to loan balances that were not included in the original loan agreement or required disclosures
- **Operating without proper licensing:** Making loans to consumers in states where the lender is not licensed to operate

**Penalties imposed in CFPB enforcement actions typically include:**

- Monetary fines paid to the CFPB's civil penalty fund
- Restitution payments directly to affected consumers (in some cases totaling tens of millions of dollars)
- Orders to cease specific practices
- Requirements to reform business operations and compliance procedures
- In severe cases, permanent bans on individuals from the lending industry

These enforcement actions serve as a deterrent and demonstrate that federal oversight has tangible consequences for lenders who violate the law. You can review CFPB enforcement actions on the [CFPB website](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/).

## What the CFPB Does NOT Do

Understanding the boundaries of the CFPB's authority is just as important as understanding its powers. Misunderstanding the CFPB's role can create false expectations about the protections available to you.

**The CFPB does not:**

- **Cap interest rates.** The CFPB has no authority to set maximum interest rates or fees for payday loans. Interest rate regulation is handled at the state level. If your state permits payday lenders to charge $15 per $100 (391% APR), the CFPB cannot override that rate. The Military Lending Act, enforced by the Department of Defense, caps rates at 36% APR for active-duty military and their dependents, but this is not a CFPB rule.

<StatHighlight value="36%" label="APR cap under the Military Lending Act for active-duty military — the only federal rate cap on payday-style loans" icon="shield" variant="gray" />
- **Approve or endorse specific lenders.** The CFPB does not certify, endorse, or recommend any financial institution. Being subject to CFPB regulation does not mean a lender has been "approved" by the government.
- **Guarantee loan outcomes.** The CFPB ensures fair practices, not favorable results. Filing a complaint does not guarantee you will receive a refund or that the company will change its decision.
- **Replace state regulations.** Federal rules establish a minimum level of consumer protection. States can — and often do — impose additional, stricter requirements on payday lenders. Your state's rules may provide significantly more protection than federal rules alone.

## State vs. Federal Regulation: How They Interact

Payday lending regulation in the United States operates on two levels simultaneously: federal rules set by the CFPB, and state laws enacted by individual state legislatures. Understanding how these two layers interact is critical for knowing your full range of protections.

**The general principle:** Federal law sets the floor, not the ceiling. The CFPB's rules establish minimum protections that apply everywhere. States can add stronger protections on top of federal requirements, but they cannot weaken them.

| Area of Regulation | What the CFPB Covers (Federal) | What States Cover |
|---|---|---|
| **Interest rates and fees** | No federal cap on payday loan rates | States set maximum rates, fees, and APR caps |
| **Loan amounts** | No federal cap on loan size | States set maximum loan amounts (often $300-$1,000) |
| **Loan terms** | No federal minimum or maximum term | States set minimum and maximum repayment periods |
| **Payment withdrawals** | Notice required before debiting accounts; limits on failed attempts | Some states add additional protections |
| **Cost disclosures** | TILA requires APR, finance charge, total payments, and schedule | States may require additional disclosures |
| **Rollovers** | No federal rollover limit | States set rollover limits or ban rollovers entirely |
| **Licensing** | No federal payday lending license | States require lender licensing and can revoke licenses |
| **Unfair practices** | UDAAP authority to pursue deceptive or abusive conduct | State consumer protection laws add enforcement |
| **Payday lending bans** | No federal ban | Approximately 18 states and D.C. effectively ban payday lending |

This two-tiered system means that a payday lender in Texas operates under different state rules than one in Ohio, but both must comply with the same CFPB federal requirements. It also means that if your state bans payday lending entirely, the CFPB's rules don't create a federal right to access payday loans.

## How to Use CFPB Resources

The CFPB provides several free tools and resources that are directly relevant to payday loan borrowers. These are funded by taxpayers and exist specifically for you to use.

<Callout type="tip" title="File a Complaint — It Matters">
Filing a complaint creates an official record the CFPB uses to identify patterns of harmful behavior. When a company accumulates significant complaints, it increases the likelihood of enforcement action. **Every complaint helps protect future borrowers.**
</Callout>

**Complaint portal.** If you have a problem with a payday lender — unauthorized charges, misleading terms, collection harassment, or any other issue — file a complaint at [consumerfinance.gov/complaint](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/). The system is straightforward: describe your issue, provide supporting documentation, and submit. The CFPB will forward it to the company and track the response.

**Consumer tools for payday loans.** The CFPB maintains a dedicated [payday loan information page](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/payday-loans/) with plain-language explanations of how payday loans work, what your rights are, and what to do if you're struggling with payday loan debt.

**Ask CFPB knowledge base.** The "Ask CFPB" section of the website provides answers to hundreds of common consumer finance questions, organized by topic. Searching "payday loan" returns detailed responses to questions about your rights, what to do if you can't repay, how to stop automatic payments, and more.

**Financial education resources.** The CFPB offers budgeting tools, financial planning guides, and educational materials designed to help consumers make better financial decisions. These resources are free, unbiased, and do not promote any specific product or company.

## Staying Protected

Federal regulation provides a foundation, but your best protection comes from being an informed borrower. Here are the practical steps that keep you safe when dealing with payday lenders.

**Verify lender licensing.** Before applying, confirm that the lender is licensed in your state. Check your state's financial regulatory agency website for a list of licensed lenders. An unlicensed lender is operating illegally, and you have limited recourse if something goes wrong. Learn more in our guide on [how to avoid predatory lenders](/guides/how-to-avoid-predatory-lenders).

<Callout type="info" title="Your Four Key Disclosures">
Federal law requires every lender to provide these **in writing** before you sign: (1) the APR, (2) the finance charge, (3) the total of payments, and (4) the payment schedule. If any are missing or unclear, do not proceed.
</Callout>

**Read all disclosures before signing.** Federal law requires lenders to provide you with the APR, finance charge, total payments, and payment schedule in writing before you commit. If a lender does not provide these disclosures — or pressures you to sign before you've read them — do not proceed.

**Know your state laws.** Your state may offer protections beyond what the CFPB provides, including rate caps, rollover limits, cooling-off periods, and mandatory extended payment plans. Understanding [your rights as a borrower](/guides/your-rights-as-borrower) at both the federal and state level gives you the full picture.

**Monitor your bank account.** After taking out a payday loan, watch your bank account closely for unauthorized withdrawals or amounts that don't match your loan agreement. If you see an unauthorized debit, contact your bank immediately to dispute it and file a complaint with the CFPB.

**File complaints when appropriate.** The complaint system works better when consumers use it. If a lender violates your rights, misleads you about costs, or engages in abusive collection practices, filing a complaint with the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) creates a record that helps protect future borrowers. You should also file with your [state's financial regulator](/guides/how-to-file-complaint-against-lender) for maximum impact.

**Understand your alternatives.** Before committing to a payday loan, consider whether another option might cost less. [Installment loans](/loans/installment) allow you to repay over months rather than weeks, credit union payday alternative loans (PALs) cap rates at 28%, and [how payday loans work](/guides/how-payday-loans-work) can help you decide if this product is right for your situation.
