  - question: "Can I get a loan with no credit history?"
    answer: "Yes, but your options are more limited and rates will be higher. Lenders that accept first-time borrowers include online lenders using alternative data, credit unions (especially if you're a member), secured loan providers, and some payday lenders. Building credit first with a secured credit card or credit-builder loan can help you qualify for better rates."
  - question: "What is the easiest loan to get as a first-time borrower?"
    answer: "Secured loans (backed by a deposit or collateral) are the easiest to get because the lender has less risk. Payday loans also have low requirements but are expensive. Credit union loans may be accessible if you have an account history. For the best balance of accessibility and cost, try a credit union personal loan or secured loan."
  - question: "How much should I borrow for my first loan?"
    answer: "Borrow only what you need — not the maximum you're approved for. Start small. A smaller loan is easier to manage, reduces risk, and successfully repaying it builds your credit for future borrowing. Ensure the monthly payment fits comfortably in your budget (under 10-15% of your take-home pay)."
  - question: "What is APR and why does it matter?"
    answer: "APR (Annual Percentage Rate) is the total yearly cost of borrowing, including interest and fees, expressed as a percentage. It's the best way to compare loan costs between lenders. A $1,000 loan at 12% APR costs less in total than the same loan at 36% APR. Always compare APRs, not just monthly payments."
  - question: "Will my first loan affect my credit score?"
    answer: "Yes, in both positive and negative ways. A hard credit inquiry at application may lower your score slightly (5-10 points temporarily). Making on-time payments builds positive credit history. Missing payments damages your score. A successfully repaid loan establishes you as a responsible borrower."

If you have never borrowed money before, the process can feel overwhelming. The terminology is unfamiliar, the options seem endless, and every advertisement promises the best deal. The fear of making a costly mistake keeps many people from taking a step that could actually improve their financial position when done responsibly.

Here is the reality: borrowing money is not inherently risky or irresponsible. According to the Federal Reserve, approximately 80% of American adults carry some form of debt — mortgages, auto loans, student loans, credit cards, personal loans. Borrowing is a financial tool, the same way a hammer is a building tool. Used correctly, it helps you accomplish things you could not do with cash alone. Used carelessly, it causes damage. The difference is understanding what you are agreeing to before you sign.

This guide is designed to give you that understanding. Whether you need a small loan to cover an emergency expense, want to consolidate a few bills, or are considering borrowing for the first time to build a credit history, the information below will help you make a confident, informed decision.

## Loan Basics: Key Terms You Need to Know

Before you compare lenders, fill out applications, or sign any documents, you need to speak the language. These are the essential terms you will encounter throughout the borrowing process. Understanding each one protects you from confusion, hidden costs, and unfavorable terms.

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Principal** | The amount of money you borrow. If you take out a $2,000 loan, your principal is $2,000. |
| **Interest** | The cost the lender charges for lending you money, expressed as a percentage of the principal. It is how lenders make their profit. |
| **APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** | The total yearly cost of borrowing, including the interest rate plus mandatory fees (like origination fees), expressed as a single percentage. APR is the best number for comparing loan costs across lenders. |
| **Term** | The length of time you have to repay the loan. A 12-month term means you make payments for one year. Longer terms mean smaller payments but more total interest paid. |
| **Monthly Payment** | The fixed amount you pay each month, which includes a portion of principal and a portion of interest. |
| **Origination Fee** | A one-time fee some lenders charge to process your loan, typically 1% to 8% of the loan amount. It is often deducted from your disbursement, meaning you receive less than you borrowed. |
| **Collateral** | An asset (car, savings account, property) you pledge to secure a loan. If you default, the lender can seize the collateral. |
| **Secured Loan** | A loan backed by collateral. Lower risk for the lender, so rates are typically lower. |
| **Unsecured Loan** | A loan with no collateral. Higher risk for the lender, so rates are typically higher. Most personal loans are unsecured. |
| **Hard Credit Inquiry** | A formal credit check that appears on your credit report when you apply for a loan. Can lower your score by 3 to 10 points temporarily. |
| **Soft Credit Inquiry** | A preliminary credit check that does not affect your score. Used for pre-qualification and rate estimates. |
| **Credit Score** | A three-digit number (300-850) that represents your creditworthiness. Higher scores qualify for lower rates and better terms. |
| **Default** | Failure to repay a loan according to the agreed terms. Defaults severely damage your credit and can result in collections, lawsuits, or asset seizure. |
| **Prepayment Penalty** | A fee some lenders charge if you pay off your loan before the scheduled end date. Not all lenders charge this — always ask. |

Bookmark this table and refer back to it as you move through the process. When a lender uses a term you do not recognize, do not nod along — ask them to explain it. A legitimate lender will do so clearly and patiently.

## Types of Loans Available

Not all loans are the same, and the best choice depends on how much you need, how quickly you need it, what you can offer as collateral, and your credit history. Here is a brief overview of the loan types most relevant to first-time borrowers.

**Personal installment loans** are the most versatile option for most borrowers. You receive a lump sum and repay it in fixed monthly payments over a set term — typically 6 to 60 months. Rates vary widely based on your credit profile, from roughly 6% to 36% APR. Installment loans work for almost any purpose: debt consolidation, emergency expenses, car repairs, medical bills, or major purchases. Most online lenders and credit unions offer them. Learn more in our guide on [how installment loans work](/loans/installment).

**Payday loans** are small, short-term loans (typically $100 to $1,000) designed to be repaid by your next paycheck — usually within two to four weeks. They are fast and easy to qualify for, but they are expensive. A typical payday loan charges $15 to $30 per $100 borrowed, which translates to APRs of 200% to 780%. Payday loans make sense only when you need a very small amount for a very short time and you are certain you can repay in full on the due date. Read more about [how payday loans work](/loans/payday).

**Credit union loans** are offered by member-owned, nonprofit financial institutions that frequently provide lower rates than banks or online lenders. If you are a credit union member, this should be your first stop. Many credit unions also offer Payday Alternative Loans (PALs), which are small-dollar loans capped at 28% APR — far cheaper than traditional payday loans.

**Secured loans** require collateral — a savings account, certificate of deposit, or vehicle — to back the loan. Because the lender's risk is reduced, secured loans offer lower interest rates and are easier to qualify for, even with no credit history. The trade-off is that you risk losing your collateral if you default.

**Credit-builder loans** are specifically designed for people with no credit or thin credit files. The loan amount is held in a locked savings account while you make monthly payments that are reported to the credit bureaus. When the loan is paid off, the savings are released to you. The result is a positive payment history and a lump sum of savings. For a complete breakdown, read our guide on [credit-builder loans](/guides/credit-builder-loans).

## How to Decide If You Should Borrow

Not every financial need requires a loan. Before you apply anywhere, run through this checklist honestly. If three or more of your answers lean toward "uncertain" or "no," borrowing may not be the right move right now.

**Is this a need or a want?** Emergency car repairs, medical bills, and essential home repairs are needs. A vacation, new electronics, or a wardrobe upgrade are wants. Borrowing for wants rarely makes financial sense because you pay interest on something that does not generate value.

**Can I afford the monthly payment?** A general guideline is to keep loan payments under 10% to 15% of your take-home pay. If your monthly income is $3,000, a loan payment of $300 to $450 is at the upper limit of what you should consider. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to estimate payments at different amounts, rates, and terms before you apply.

**Have I explored alternatives?** Can you negotiate a payment plan with the creditor or service provider? Could you borrow from a family member? Is there a community assistance program, employer advance, or savings account that could cover the expense? Exhausting free or low-cost options first is always the smartest move.

**What is the total cost of borrowing?** Do not just look at the monthly payment. Calculate how much you will repay in total — principal plus all interest and fees. If the total cost of a $1,000 loan is $1,200, you are paying $200 for the privilege of borrowing. Is that cost worth it for your situation?

**Can I repay on time, every time?** Missing even one payment triggers late fees, may increase your interest rate, and damages your credit score. If there is a realistic chance you will miss payments, borrowing creates more problems than it solves.

If your answers are mostly "yes" — you have a genuine need, the payment fits your budget, and you are confident in your ability to repay — then borrowing can be a reasonable and productive financial decision.

## Understanding APR: The Most Important Number

If you remember only one thing from this guide, let it be this: **APR is the number that matters most when comparing loans.** Not the interest rate alone. Not the monthly payment. Not the lender's marketing language. The APR.

APR — Annual Percentage Rate — represents the total cost of borrowing expressed as a yearly percentage. It includes the interest rate plus mandatory fees like origination charges. This is why two loans with the same interest rate can have different APRs: one might charge a 5% origination fee that the other does not.

Federal law requires every lender to disclose the APR before you sign. It exists specifically so you can make apples-to-apples comparisons between different loan offers.

Here is what APR differences look like in practice on a $1,000 loan repaid over 12 months:

| APR | Monthly Payment | Total Repaid | Total Cost of Borrowing |
|---|---|---|---|
| 12% | $89 | $1,066 | $66 |
| 24% | $94 | $1,133 | $133 |
| 36% | $100 | $1,197 | $197 |

The difference between 12% APR and 36% APR on a $1,000 loan is $131 — and that gap scales with larger loan amounts and longer terms. On a $5,000 loan over 24 months, the difference between 12% and 36% APR is over $1,300. Small percentage differences translate into real money.

This is why shopping around matters so much. The same borrower can receive APR offers ranging from 10% to 36% depending on the lender, because each lender uses a different risk model. Taking the time to compare three to five offers is one of the most financially impactful things you can do.

## How to Choose Your First Loan

Choosing a loan is a process, not a leap. Follow these steps in order and you will end up with the best option available to you.

**Step 1: Determine exactly how much you need.** Write down the specific expense or expenses the loan will cover. Add a small buffer for any associated costs (such as taxes or shipping), but do not round up to a larger amount just because you qualify for more. Borrowing more than you need means paying interest on money you did not use.

**Step 2: Check your credit score.** Knowing your score tells you which loan products you are likely to qualify for and what rate range to expect. You can check your score for free through your bank's app, Credit Karma, or the Experian app. For a full walkthrough, see our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free).

**Step 3: Compare three to five offers.** Apply for pre-qualification with multiple lenders. Most online lenders offer soft-pull pre-qualification that shows your estimated rate and terms without impacting your credit score. Collect at least three offers so you can compare meaningfully. Our guide on [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers) provides a step-by-step framework.

**Step 4: Compare total cost, not just monthly payments.** A lower monthly payment over a longer term often costs more in total interest. Ask each lender for the total amount you will repay, then compare side by side. The table in the APR section above shows how this works in practice.

**Step 5: Read every term before signing.** Every word. Look for origination fees, prepayment penalties, late payment fees, variable rate clauses, and mandatory arbitration provisions. If you do not understand something, ask the lender to explain. If they cannot or will not explain clearly, that is a red flag. Our guide on [questions to ask before taking a loan](/guides/questions-to-ask-before-taking-loan) gives you a complete checklist.

## Building Credit with Your First Loan

One of the most valuable benefits of your first loan — beyond solving the immediate financial need — is the opportunity to establish a credit history. A positive credit history opens doors to lower interest rates, higher borrowing limits, better insurance premiums, and easier apartment approvals for years to come.

Here is how it works: if your lender reports payment activity to the three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion), every on-time payment you make is recorded on your credit file as positive history. Payment history is the single largest factor in your credit score, accounting for 35% of your FICO score. After six months of consistent on-time payments, you will typically see a measurable improvement in your score.

**Before you sign, ask the lender:** "Do you report payment history to the credit bureaus? Which ones?" The ideal answer is all three. At minimum, the lender should report to at least one. If the lender does not report to any bureau, you are paying interest without getting credit-building value — which is a significant missed opportunity.

Successfully repaying your first loan in full establishes you as a responsible borrower. The next time you need credit — whether it is a car loan, a better credit card, or a larger personal loan — your history works in your favor, qualifying you for better rates and terms.

## Common First-Time Borrower Mistakes

Every experienced borrower learned some of these lessons the hard way. You can skip the costly education by knowing what to avoid from the start.

**Borrowing more than you need.** Getting approved for $5,000 when you only need $2,000 is not a win — it is a trap. The extra $3,000 sits in your account tempting you to spend it, while you pay interest on every dollar. Borrow the amount you need and not a cent more.

**Focusing only on the monthly payment.** A lender who offers you a $3,000 loan at $85 per month sounds affordable. But if that is a 48-month term at 32% APR, you will repay over $4,080 — more than $1,000 in interest and fees. Always ask for the total repayment amount and compare that number across offers.

**Not reading the fine print.** The loan agreement is a legally binding contract. Buried in the pages you are tempted to skip may be a prepayment penalty, a variable rate clause, a mandatory arbitration provision, or automatic renewal terms. Read every section. If you sign it, you agreed to it.

**Missing payments.** A single missed payment can trigger a late fee of $15 to $39, a penalty interest rate increase, and a negative mark on your credit report that stays for seven years. Set up autopay the day your loan is funded. Remove the possibility of forgetting entirely.

**Borrowing from the first lender you find.** The first offer is rarely the best offer. Interest rates for the same borrower profile can vary by 10 percentage points or more across lenders. Taking 30 minutes to compare three to five offers can save you hundreds of dollars.

**Taking a payday loan when an installment loan would be cheaper.** Payday loans are fast and easy, but their APRs (200% to 780%) make them among the most expensive borrowing options available. If you can qualify for a personal installment loan — even at a high rate — the total cost will almost always be lower. Compare your options before defaulting to payday.

## Red Flags: When to Walk Away

Not every lender has your best interests in mind. These warning signs indicate you should stop the process and look elsewhere.

**"Guaranteed approval" claims.** No legitimate lender can guarantee approval before reviewing your application. Guarantees are either lies to get you in the door or signs that the terms will be so extreme the lender profits regardless of whether you repay.

**Upfront fees before you receive money.** Legitimate lenders deduct fees from the loan proceeds or add them to the balance. They never ask you to pay out of pocket, wire money, or send a gift card before disbursing your loan. If someone asks for money before giving you money, it is a scam.

**Pressure to act immediately.** "This rate expires in one hour." "Sign now or lose your spot." Legitimate lending offers do not evaporate because you took a day to review the terms. Pressure is a manipulation tactic designed to prevent you from thinking clearly or comparing alternatives.

**No written terms or disclosures.** Federal law requires lenders to disclose the APR, total finance charges, and payment schedule before you sign. If a lender refuses to provide these in writing, gives only verbal quotes, or buries the numbers in pages of confusing language, they are hiding the true cost.

**APR not clearly disclosed.** If you ask "What is the APR?" and the lender deflects, quotes only a monthly rate, or says they will tell you after you sign, leave. APR disclosure before signing is not optional — it is federal law under the [Truth in Lending Act](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/).

**Unlicensed lender.** Every state requires lenders to hold a valid license. An unlicensed lender is operating illegally and is not subject to state consumer protections, rate caps, or regulatory oversight. Verify licensing through your state's financial regulator before sharing personal information.

If you encounter any of these red flags, do not proceed. Walk away, report the lender, and find a legitimate alternative. For a comprehensive guide to identifying and avoiding predatory practices, read our detailed guide on [how to avoid predatory lenders](/guides/how-to-avoid-predatory-lenders).
