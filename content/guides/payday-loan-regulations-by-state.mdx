faqs:
  - question: "Are payday loans legal in every state?"
    answer: "No. As of 2026, approximately 18 states and the District of Columbia effectively ban or severely restrict payday lending through rate caps, outright prohibitions, or regulatory frameworks that make traditional payday lending unviable. The remaining 32 states permit payday loans with varying degrees of regulation, from strict consumer protections to minimal oversight."
  - question: "What is the maximum APR for a payday loan?"
    answer: "Maximum APRs vary dramatically by state. States with rate caps that effectively ban payday loans typically limit APRs to 36% or less. Permissive states may allow APRs exceeding 400% to 600% or impose no explicit APR cap at all, instead regulating fees per amount borrowed. A typical two-week payday loan of $300 with a $45 fee carries an APR of approximately 391%."
  - question: "Can I get a payday loan online if my state bans them?"
    answer: "Licensed online lenders are generally required to follow the laws of the state where the borrower resides, not where the lender is headquartered. If your state bans payday loans, a legitimate lender should not issue one to you. However, some unlicensed or offshore lenders may attempt to circumvent state law. Borrowing from an unlicensed lender leaves you with fewer legal protections. Always verify that any online lender is licensed in your state."
  - question: "What federal laws regulate payday loans?"
    answer: "The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires lenders to disclose the APR, total finance charges, and repayment terms before you sign. The Military Lending Act (MLA) caps loans to active-duty service members and dependents at 36% APR. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) oversees payday lending at the federal level and enforces rules against unfair, deceptive, or abusive practices."
  - question: "What should I do if a payday lender violates my state's laws?"
    answer: "File a complaint with your state attorney general's office and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau at consumerfinance.gov/complaint. Document all communications, save copies of your loan agreement, and note the specific violation. Many states allow borrowers to recover damages or void illegal loan contracts. You may also contact a legal aid organization for free legal assistance."

## Understanding Payday Loan Regulation in the United States

Payday loan regulation in the United States operates primarily at the state level, creating a patchwork of laws that varies enormously from one state to the next. Some states have banned payday lending entirely, while others allow lenders to charge triple-digit annual percentage rates with minimal borrower protections.

As of 2026, approximately **32 states allow payday lending** in some form, while **18 states and the District of Columbia** have effectively banned or severely restricted the practice through rate caps, outright prohibitions, or regulatory structures that make traditional payday lending economically unviable for lenders.

Understanding the laws in your state is essential before considering a payday loan. This guide covers the three main regulatory approaches, a complete state-by-state breakdown, how fees and APRs actually work, federal protections that apply everywhere, and what to do based on the laws where you live.

For a broader overview of how these products work, see our guide on [how payday loans work](/guides/how-payday-loans-work).

## Three Regulatory Approaches to Payday Lending

State payday loan laws generally fall into one of three categories. Understanding which approach your state takes is the first step in knowing your rights and protections.

### Prohibitive States

These states have effectively eliminated traditional payday lending, usually by imposing interest rate caps at or near 36% APR. Since payday lenders typically cannot operate profitably under these caps, the industry does not exist in these markets in its traditional form.

**States that ban or effectively prohibit payday loans:** Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, Virginia, West Virginia, and the District of Columbia.

Note that several of these states, such as Colorado, Illinois, Oregon, and Virginia, have transitioned from permissive to prohibitive or heavily regulated frameworks in recent years by enacting rate cap legislation and extended repayment requirements.

For a deeper look at these jurisdictions, see our guide on [states that ban payday loans](/guides/states-that-ban-payday-loans).

### Regulated States

These states permit payday lending but impose meaningful consumer protections such as moderate rate caps, database tracking systems to prevent simultaneous borrowing from multiple lenders, mandatory extended payment plan options, cooling-off periods between loans, and limits on rollovers.

**Examples:** Ohio, Washington, Hawaii, Indiana, Minnesota, and Louisiana have implemented regulatory frameworks that allow short-term lending while attempting to curb the most harmful practices.

### Permissive States

These states allow payday lending with relatively few restrictions. Lenders may charge high fees, APR caps may be absent or extremely high, rollover protections may be weak or nonexistent, and borrowers have limited recourse.

**Examples:** Texas, Utah, Idaho, Nevada, Missouri, and Wisconsin are among the most lender-friendly states with limited regulatory guardrails.

## States with the Strongest Borrower Protections

Several states have implemented payday loan reform laws that serve as models for consumer protection. These frameworks balance access to small-dollar credit with meaningful safeguards against debt traps.

### Colorado

Colorado's 2018 Proposition 111 capped APR at 36% plus a maintenance fee and eliminated traditional two-week payday loans. Loans must have a minimum term of six months. The reform effectively converted payday loans into small installment loans with affordable repayment schedules.

### Ohio

Ohio's 2018 Fairness in Lending Act capped monthly fees at 10% of the original loan principal, limited total fees to 60% of the principal, and set a maximum APR of 28%. Loans range from $200 to $1,000 with terms of 91 days to 12 months. The law also requires lenders to check whether borrowers can afford the payments.

### Virginia

Virginia's 2020 reform law capped interest at 36% APR plus a maintenance fee, required a minimum loan term of four months, and limited total costs. It replaced the state's prior payday lending framework, which had allowed triple-digit APRs.

### Oregon

Oregon has capped payday loan fees at $10 per $100 for the first $300 and $10 per $100 for amounts above $300, with a minimum term of 31 days. Loans cannot exceed $50,000 in annual income percentage, and borrowers can only have one outstanding payday loan at a time.

### Illinois

Illinois's Predatory Loan Prevention Act, effective in 2021, capped all consumer loans at 36% APR including fees, effectively banning traditional payday lending in the state.

## Permissive States: Where Borrowers Have the Least Protection

<Callout type="warning" title="Minimal Protection in Some States">
States like Texas, Utah, Idaho, and Nevada impose few restrictions on payday lenders. In Texas, APRs commonly exceed **400% to 600%** under the Credit Services Organization model. Exercise extreme caution when borrowing in these states.
</Callout>

In contrast, several states impose minimal restrictions on payday lenders, leaving borrowers exposed to high costs and debt cycle risk.

**Texas** does not cap payday loan fees under its Credit Services Organization (CSO) model. Lenders operate as credit service organizations rather than direct lenders, which allows them to charge fees that translate to APRs commonly exceeding 400% to 600%. Rollovers are permitted with additional fees.

**Utah** imposes no maximum loan amount, no APR cap, and no restriction on the number of outstanding loans. Borrowers can hold multiple payday loans simultaneously, increasing debt accumulation risk.

**Idaho** has no fee or rate cap on payday loans and no limit on rollovers. The maximum loan amount is $1,000 with a maximum term of 35 days.

**Nevada** allows payday loans up to 25% of the borrower's gross monthly income with no explicit APR cap. The default limit on extensions is one, though enforcement varies.

## Understanding Payday Loan Fee Structures

Payday loan fees are typically expressed as a dollar amount per $100 borrowed rather than as an annual percentage rate, which can obscure the true cost of borrowing.

### How Fees Translate to APR

<StatHighlight value="391%" label="APR on a typical $15-per-$100 payday loan with a 14-day term" icon="trending-up" variant="red" />

A fee of $15 per $100 on a 14-day loan translates to an APR of approximately **391%**. The shorter the term, the higher the effective APR for the same dollar fee. Here is how common fee structures compare:

| Fee per $100 | 7-Day Loan APR | 14-Day Loan APR | 30-Day Loan APR |
|---|---|---|---|
| $10 | 521% | 260% | 122% |
| $15 | 782% | 391% | 183% |
| $20 | 1,043% | 521% | 243% |
| $25 | 1,304% | 651% | 304% |

### The True Cost of Rollovers

Rollovers occur when a borrower cannot repay the loan by the due date and extends it by paying another fee. In states that allow rollovers, a single $300 loan can quickly cost far more than the original amount borrowed.

**Example:** A $300 loan with a $45 fee ($15 per $100) rolled over three times costs $180 in fees alone, bringing the total repayment to $480 for a $300 loan. After six rollovers, the borrower has paid $270 in fees, nearly the original loan amount, while still owing the full $300 principal.

<Callout type="cost" title="Rollovers Turn Small Loans Into Big Debt">
A $300 loan with a $45 fee rolled over three times costs **$180 in fees alone** — bringing the total to $480. After six rollovers, you will have paid $270 in fees while still owing the full $300 principal.
</Callout>

This rollover cycle is the primary mechanism through which payday loans become debt traps. The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/payday-loans/) reports that the majority of payday loan fees come from borrowers who take out more than 10 loans per year.

## Federal Regulations That Apply in Every State

Regardless of state law, several federal statutes provide baseline protections for all payday loan borrowers.

### Truth in Lending Act (TILA)

TILA requires every lender to clearly disclose the **APR**, the **finance charge** in dollar terms, the **amount financed**, and the **total of payments** before the borrower signs. If a lender fails to provide these disclosures, the loan may be voidable, and the lender may face penalties.

### Military Lending Act (MLA)

The MLA caps interest at **36% APR** (including all fees) on loans to active-duty service members and their dependents. This effectively prohibits traditional payday lending to military families regardless of state law. Lenders must verify military status and cannot require allotment repayment or mandatory arbitration.

### Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)

The CFPB has authority to supervise and enforce rules against payday lenders at the federal level. The bureau's payday lending rule, which has undergone revisions since its original 2017 proposal, addresses underwriting requirements and payment withdrawal protections. The CFPB also maintains a public complaint database and accepts consumer complaints against payday lenders.

### Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA)

Under EFTA, lenders cannot require borrowers to authorize electronic access to their bank accounts as a condition of receiving a loan. Borrowers have the right to revoke electronic payment authorization at any time.

## What to Do Based on Your State's Laws

### If Your State Bans Payday Loans

You still have options for small-dollar borrowing. Explore [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) including credit union Payday Alternative Loans (PALs), [installment loans](/loans/installment) with regulated rates, cash advance apps, nonprofit emergency assistance programs, and employer-based payroll advances. Use our [calculator](/calculator) to compare the true cost of different borrowing options.

### If Your State Allows Payday Loans with Protections

Take advantage of every protection available. Verify that the lender is licensed with your state's financial regulator, confirm the loan terms comply with state maximums, ask about extended payment plan options if you anticipate difficulty repaying, and check whether your state maintains a loan database that prevents you from taking multiple simultaneous loans.

### If Your State Has Minimal Regulation

<Callout type="info" title="Know Your Rights Before Borrowing">
Regardless of state law, the Truth in Lending Act requires lenders to disclose APR and total cost. Verify any lender's license with your state's financial regulator and **never borrow more than you can repay** from your next paycheck.
</Callout>

Exercise extreme caution. Borrow the absolute minimum amount needed, have a concrete repayment plan before signing, never roll over a loan if you can avoid it, and explore whether [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) in your area offer lower-cost options. Consider whether a [small installment loan](/loans/installment) with structured monthly payments would better serve your needs.

### For Everyone

Regardless of your state's regulatory framework, the following steps protect your interests:

1. **Read every word of the loan agreement** before signing. Confirm the APR, total repayment amount, due date, fees for late payment, and rollover terms.
2. **Verify the lender's license** with your state's banking or financial institutions department.
3. **Never borrow more than you can repay** from your next paycheck while still covering essential expenses.
4. **Know your right to an extended payment plan** if your state requires lenders to offer one.
5. **File a complaint** with your state attorney general and the CFPB if a lender violates any law or engages in deceptive practices.

## Explore Lower-Cost Alternatives

Payday loans serve as last-resort borrowing for a reason. The combination of high fees, short terms, and rollover structures makes them among the most expensive forms of consumer credit available. Before using a payday loan, review every available alternative through our [payday loan alternatives guide](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) and compare costs using our [loan calculator](/calculator).

If you have determined that a short-term loan is necessary, compare offers from multiple [licensed lenders](/states) and choose the option with the lowest total repayment cost.
