  - question: "What is the main difference between a line of credit and a personal loan?"
    answer: "A personal loan gives you a lump sum upfront that you repay in fixed monthly installments. A line of credit gives you access to a pool of money you can draw from as needed, and you only pay interest on what you actually use. Think of a personal loan like a one-time purchase and a line of credit like a credit card."
  - question: "Which has lower interest rates?"
    answer: "Personal loans typically have lower APRs (6-36%) than personal lines of credit (8-24% for secured, 14-36% for unsecured), though this varies by lender and your credit profile. However, with a line of credit you only pay interest on what you borrow, so the total cost may be lower if you don't use the full amount."
  - question: "Can I get a line of credit with bad credit?"
    answer: "It's more difficult. Lines of credit generally require higher credit scores (650+) than personal loans because they represent an ongoing credit commitment. With bad credit, a personal loan — especially from an online lender that specializes in bad credit — may be easier to obtain."
  - question: "Is a HELOC a line of credit?"
    answer: "Yes. A HELOC (Home Equity Line of Credit) is a secured line of credit that uses your home as collateral. It typically offers the lowest APRs (3-10%) but puts your home at risk if you can't repay. Personal lines of credit are usually unsecured and don't require home ownership."
  - question: "Which is better for an emergency?"
    answer: "For a one-time emergency expense with a known cost, a personal loan is usually better — you get the full amount, know your exact payments, and can budget accordingly. For ongoing or unpredictable expenses, a line of credit offers more flexibility since you only draw what you need when you need it."

Personal loans and lines of credit are two of the most common ways to borrow money, but they work in fundamentally different ways. A personal loan hands you a fixed lump sum that you repay on a set schedule. A line of credit gives you a pool of money you can tap into whenever you need it, paying interest only on what you actually use.

Choosing the wrong one can cost you hundreds or even thousands of dollars in unnecessary interest, or leave you without the flexibility you need. This guide breaks down how each product works, what they cost, and which one makes sense for different financial situations.

## Line of Credit vs Personal Loan at a Glance

Before diving into the details, here is a side-by-side comparison of the two products:

| Feature | Personal Loan | Line of Credit |
|---|---|---|
| **How You Receive Funds** | Lump sum deposited to your account | Draw any amount up to your credit limit, as needed |
| **Repayment Structure** | Fixed monthly payments over a set term | Minimum payments during draw period; may shift to fixed payments in repayment period |
| **Interest Structure** | Interest on the full loan amount from day one | Interest only on the amount you have drawn |
| **Rate Type** | Usually fixed | Usually variable |
| **Typical APR** | 6% - 36% | 8% - 24% (secured) / 14% - 36% (unsecured) |
| **Typical Amounts** | $1,000 - $50,000 | $1,000 - $100,000+ |
| **Typical Terms** | 12 - 84 months | 12 - 60 month draw period, then repayment period |
| **Minimum Credit Score** | 580+ (varies by lender) | 650+ (generally higher requirements) |
| **Flexibility** | Low — one-time disbursement, fixed schedule | High — borrow, repay, and re-borrow during draw period |
| **Best For** | Known, one-time expenses | Ongoing or unpredictable expenses |

The core distinction comes down to structure versus flexibility. A personal loan is predictable and straightforward. A line of credit is adaptable and ongoing. Both have a place in your financial toolkit, but they solve different problems.

## How Personal Loans Work

A personal loan is an [installment loan](/loans/installment). You borrow a specific amount, receive it as a lump sum, and repay it in equal monthly payments over a fixed term, typically 12 to 84 months.

**Here is the typical process:**

1. You apply for a specific loan amount, say $10,000.
2. The lender reviews your credit, income, and debt-to-income ratio.
3. If approved, you receive the full $10,000 in your bank account, usually within one to five business days.
4. You make the same fixed monthly payment every month until the loan is paid off.
5. Once the loan is repaid, the account is closed.

Most personal loans carry a **fixed interest rate**, which means your monthly payment never changes. This makes budgeting simple. If you borrow $10,000 at 12% APR for 36 months, your payment is $332 per month every single month until it is paid off.

**Amortization** is how the repayment is structured. Each monthly payment covers both principal and interest. Early payments are interest-heavy, and later payments are principal-heavy. By the end of the term, you have paid off the entire balance plus all interest.

Personal loans may come with origination fees, typically 1% to 8% of the loan amount, which are either deducted from your disbursement or added to the loan balance. Not all lenders charge origination fees, so it pays to compare.

The simplicity of a personal loan is its biggest advantage. You know exactly how much you owe, exactly what you pay each month, and exactly when it will be paid off. There are no surprises.

## How Lines of Credit Work

A line of credit operates more like a credit card than a traditional loan. Instead of receiving a lump sum, you get access to a credit limit, a maximum amount you can borrow at any time. You draw from that limit as needed and only pay interest on the amount you have actually borrowed.

**Here is how it works in practice:**

1. You are approved for a line of credit with a $10,000 limit.
2. During the **draw period** (typically 12 to 60 months), you can borrow any amount up to $10,000.
3. You draw $3,000 for a home repair. You only pay interest on the $3,000, not the full $10,000 limit.
4. You make payments against that $3,000 balance. As you pay it down, the available credit replenishes.
5. Two months later, you need $1,500 for a car repair. You draw again. Your balance is now whatever remained from the first draw plus $1,500.
6. When the draw period ends, you enter the **repayment period**, where you can no longer borrow and must pay off the remaining balance.

Most personal lines of credit carry a **variable interest rate**, which means your rate can change over time based on market conditions. This makes monthly payments less predictable than a personal loan.

During the draw period, many lines of credit require only **minimum payments**, which may be interest-only. This keeps your required payments low, but if you only pay the minimum, you are not reducing your principal, and the total cost of borrowing increases significantly.

The revolving nature is the key advantage. You can borrow, repay, and borrow again without reapplying. This makes a line of credit ideal when you do not know exactly how much money you will need or when you will need it.

## Types of Lines of Credit

Not all lines of credit are the same. The type you can access depends on your assets, creditworthiness, and borrowing needs.

| Type | Secured? | Typical APR | Credit Limit | Key Characteristics |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Personal LOC (Unsecured)** | No | 14% - 36% | $1,000 - $25,000 | No collateral required; higher rates; requires good credit (650+) |
| **HELOC** | Yes (home) | 7% - 12% | Up to 85% of home equity | Lowest rates; puts home at risk; requires home ownership and equity; tax-deductible interest in some cases |
| **Secured Personal LOC** | Yes (savings/CD) | 8% - 18% | Up to the value of collateral | Lower rates than unsecured; requires a deposit or asset as collateral |
| **Business LOC** | Varies | 8% - 24% | $5,000 - $500,000+ | For business expenses; may require business revenue history; personal guarantee often required |

For most individual borrowers, the choice is between an unsecured personal line of credit and a HELOC. If you own a home with equity, a HELOC offers dramatically lower rates but carries the serious risk of losing your home if you default. An unsecured personal line of credit is lower-stakes but more expensive.

## Cost Comparison

The real question is: which one costs less? The answer depends on how much of your available credit you actually use.

Let us compare two scenarios using a $5,000 borrowing need:

### Scenario 1: You Need the Full $5,000

| | Personal Loan | Line of Credit |
|---|---|---|
| Amount Borrowed | $5,000 | $5,000 |
| APR | 12% (fixed) | 15% (variable) |
| Repayment Period | 24 months | 24 months |
| Monthly Payment | ~$235 | ~$242 |
| Total Interest Paid | ~$640 | ~$808 |
| **Total Cost** | **~$5,640** | **~$5,808** |

**Winner: Personal loan.** When you need the full amount, the personal loan's lower fixed rate saves you money. The line of credit's higher variable rate costs you an extra $168 over two years.

### Scenario 2: You Only Need $2,000 of a $5,000 Limit

| | Personal Loan | Line of Credit |
|---|---|---|
| Amount Borrowed | $5,000 (must take full amount) | $2,000 (draw only what you need) |
| APR | 12% (fixed) | 15% (variable) |
| Repayment Period | 24 months | 24 months |
| Monthly Payment | ~$235 | ~$97 |
| Total Interest Paid | ~$640 | ~$323 |
| **Total Cost** | **~$5,640** | **~$2,323** |

**Winner: Line of credit, by a wide margin.** Even with a higher APR, you pay $317 less in interest because you are only paying interest on $2,000 instead of $5,000. Plus, your monthly payment is less than half the personal loan payment, freeing up cash flow.

This is the fundamental trade-off. Personal loans win on rate. Lines of credit win on flexibility. The right choice depends on how precisely you know your borrowing needs.

## When to Choose a Personal Loan

A personal loan is the better choice when your borrowing needs are clear, defined, and one-time. Choose a personal loan when:

- **You know exactly how much you need.** If your car repair costs $4,200 or your debt consolidation target is $15,000, a personal loan gives you exactly that amount with no temptation to overborrow.
- **You want predictable payments.** Fixed rate, fixed payment, fixed term. You can set up autopay and never think about it. This makes budgeting straightforward and eliminates the risk of rising variable rates.
- **You want to build credit with a structured repayment.** Installment loans with on-time payments are excellent for building credit history. The fixed schedule makes it easy to stay on track.
- **You prefer simplicity.** One disbursement, one payment schedule, one payoff date. No draw periods, no variable rates, no minimum-payment traps.
- **You have fair or bad credit.** Personal loans are available to a wider range of credit scores than lines of credit. Many online lenders offer [bad-credit personal loans](/loans/bad-credit) with scores as low as 580, while lines of credit typically require 650 or higher.

## When to Choose a Line of Credit

A line of credit is the better choice when your borrowing needs are ongoing, uncertain, or spread over time. Choose a line of credit when:

- **You have ongoing expenses without a fixed total.** A home renovation that unfolds in phases, a series of medical treatments, or seasonal business expenses are all better served by a credit line you can tap as needed.
- **You are not sure how much you will need.** If the final cost is uncertain, a line of credit prevents you from borrowing too much (and paying unnecessary interest) or too little (and needing to apply for a second loan).
- **You want a financial safety net.** An open line of credit serves as a backup for unexpected expenses. You pay nothing unless you draw on it, and some lines of credit have no annual fee when unused.
- **You have good to excellent credit.** Borrowers with scores of 700 or above get the best line-of-credit terms. If your credit is strong, you can access competitive rates that make the variable-rate risk more manageable.
- **You want to borrow and repay repeatedly.** During the draw period, every dollar you repay becomes available to borrow again. This revolving access is valuable when cash needs are irregular.

## Common Use Cases

Different financial situations call for different borrowing tools. Here is how common needs line up:

| Use Case | Better Option | Why |
|---|---|---|
| **Home renovation** | Line of credit | Costs are unpredictable; work happens in stages; you can draw as invoices arrive |
| **Debt consolidation** | Personal loan | You know the total amount; fixed payments replace variable minimums; clear payoff date |
| **Emergency fund backup** | Line of credit | You may never need it; if you do, you only borrow what the emergency requires |
| **Wedding expenses** | Personal loan | Total budget is usually planned in advance; fixed payments help manage post-wedding finances |
| **Medical bills** | Depends | Planned procedure with a known cost: personal loan. Ongoing treatment with uncertain total: line of credit |
| **Large one-time purchase** | Personal loan | Known amount, one-time need, predictable repayment |
| **Small business cash flow** | Line of credit | Revenue and expenses fluctuate; draw during slow months, repay during strong months |
| **Car repair** | Personal loan | Typically a one-time expense with a clear quote from the mechanic |
| **Tuition payments** | Line of credit | Semester-by-semester costs that spread over multiple years |

There is no universal right answer. The best choice depends on the specific shape of your financial need: how much, how often, and how predictable.

## What About Credit Cards?

Credit cards are technically a type of revolving credit, similar to a line of credit. So when does a credit card make more sense than either a personal loan or a line of credit?

**Credit cards may be better when:**

- **The amount is small (under $2,000)** and you can pay it off within a few months. Many credit cards offer 0% introductory APR periods of 12 to 21 months, which beats both personal loan and line-of-credit rates during that window.
- **You want rewards.** Cash back, travel points, and other rewards programs can offset borrowing costs for purchases you would make anyway, something neither personal loans nor lines of credit offer.
- **You need the money immediately.** Credit cards provide instant purchasing power with no application wait time.

**Credit cards are worse when:**

- **The amount is large (over $5,000).** Credit card APRs typically range from 18% to 29%, higher than either personal loans or lines of credit. On large balances, this rate difference adds up fast.
- **You need a long repayment period.** After any introductory rate expires, credit card rates are among the highest consumer rates available. A $10,000 balance at 22% APR with minimum payments could take over a decade to repay and cost you more in interest than the original balance.
- **You want structured repayment.** Credit cards have minimum payments, not fixed installments. Without discipline, balances can linger for years.

For medium to large borrowing needs, a personal loan or line of credit almost always costs less than a credit card. Credit cards are a useful tool for small, short-term needs, not for financing major expenses.

## Compare Your Options

Whether you are leaning toward a personal loan, a line of credit, or still weighing your options, the most important step is comparing actual offers from multiple lenders. Rates, fees, and terms vary widely, and the best product for you depends on your specific credit profile and financial situation.
