faqs:
  - question: "What is an installment loan?"
    answer: "An installment loan is a type of loan where you borrow a fixed amount of money and repay it in equal monthly payments (installments) over a set period, typically 3 to 60 months. Each payment includes a portion of the principal plus interest. Common examples include personal loans, auto loans, and mortgages."
  - question: "What credit score do I need for an installment loan?"
    answer: "Credit requirements vary by lender. Traditional banks typically require scores of 670 or higher. Online lenders may accept scores as low as 580, and some specialize in bad credit lending with no minimum score. Higher credit scores generally qualify for lower APRs and better terms."
  - question: "How much can I borrow with an installment loan?"
    answer: "Online personal installment loans typically range from $500 to $35,000, depending on the lender, your creditworthiness, income, and state regulations. Some lenders offer up to $50,000 or more for well-qualified borrowers."
  - question: "Can I pay off an installment loan early?"
    answer: "Most online lenders allow early repayment without penalties. However, some charge prepayment penalties. Always check the loan agreement before accepting. Paying early saves money on interest because you reduce the time the principal accrues charges."
  - question: "Do installment loans build credit?"
    answer: "Yes, if the lender reports to credit bureaus. Most reputable installment lenders report your payment history to Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion. Making on-time payments builds a positive credit history. Late payments will hurt your score."
  - question: "What is the difference between secured and unsecured installment loans?"
    answer: "Secured installment loans require collateral (like a car or savings account) that the lender can seize if you default. They typically offer lower APRs because the lender takes less risk. Unsecured installment loans require no collateral but usually have higher APRs because the lender's risk is greater."

## What Is an Installment Loan?

An installment loan is a type of financing where you borrow a fixed amount of money and repay it through a series of scheduled, equal payments over a predetermined period. Each payment — called an installment — includes a portion of the **principal** (the original amount borrowed) plus **interest** (the cost of borrowing).

Installment loans are the most common form of consumer lending in the United States. If you have ever financed a car, taken out a mortgage, or borrowed a personal loan, you have used an installment loan. The defining feature is predictability: you know exactly how much you owe each month, how many payments you will make, and when the loan will be paid in full.

Unlike revolving credit (such as credit cards), an installment loan has a clear start date and end date. You receive the funds once, make regular payments, and the account closes when the balance reaches zero. This structure makes installment loans straightforward to budget for and easier to manage than open-ended debt.

[Personal installment loans](/loans/installment) available through online lenders typically range from $500 to $35,000 with repayment terms of 3 to 60 months. The interest rate, loan amount, and term you qualify for depend on your credit profile, income, and the lender's underwriting criteria.

## How Installment Loans Work

The installment loan process follows a straightforward sequence from application to final payoff. Here is how it works step by step.

### Step 1: Apply

You submit a loan application with basic personal and financial information. This typically includes your name, address, date of birth, Social Security number, employment details, and monthly income. Most online lenders let you complete this process in under 10 minutes. Many begin with a **soft credit inquiry** that does not affect your credit score, so you can check your rate before committing.

### Step 2: Get Approved and Review Your Offer

The lender evaluates your application using your credit history, income, debt-to-income ratio, and other factors. If approved, you receive a loan offer that includes the **loan amount**, **APR** (annual percentage rate), **monthly payment**, **repayment term**, and any fees. Review these details carefully. The [APR](/guides/understanding-apr-small-dollar-loans) is the single most important number because it reflects the true annual cost of the loan, including interest and most fees.

### Step 3: Accept and Receive Funds

Once you accept the offer and sign the loan agreement, the lender disburses the funds. Most online lenders deposit money directly into your bank account. Funding timelines vary — some lenders offer next-business-day funding, while others may take two to five business days.

### Step 4: Make Monthly Payments

You repay the loan in equal monthly installments. Each payment is split between principal and interest. In the early months, a larger share of your payment goes toward interest. As the balance decreases, more of each payment goes toward principal. This is called **amortization**. Setting up autopay helps you avoid missed payments and some lenders offer a small APR discount for enrolling.

### Step 5: Loan Closes

After you make your final payment, the loan is paid in full and the account closes. If the lender reports to credit bureaus, the account will appear on your credit report as a closed, fully paid installment loan — which is positive for your credit history.

You can use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to estimate your monthly payments and total interest before applying.

## Types of Installment Loans

Installment loans come in several forms, each designed for a different purpose.

### Personal Loans

Personal loans are the most flexible type of installment loan. They are typically **unsecured**, meaning no collateral is required. You can use the funds for almost any purpose: debt consolidation, medical bills, home repairs, emergency expenses, or major purchases. Loan amounts usually range from $500 to $35,000, with terms of 3 to 60 months.

### Auto Loans

Auto loans are **secured** installment loans where the vehicle serves as collateral. Because the lender can repossess the car if you default, auto loans often carry lower APRs than unsecured personal loans. Terms typically run 36 to 72 months.

### Mortgages

A mortgage is a secured installment loan used to purchase real estate. Mortgages have the longest repayment terms — usually 15 or 30 years — and the lowest APRs of any installment loan type because the property serves as collateral.

### Student Loans

Student loans fund education expenses and come in federal and private varieties. Federal student loans offer fixed rates and income-driven repayment options. Private student loans may have fixed or variable rates and vary widely in terms and conditions.

### Debt Consolidation Loans

A debt consolidation loan is a personal loan used specifically to combine multiple debts into a single monthly payment. If the new loan has a lower APR than your existing debts, you save money on interest and simplify your finances.

This guide focuses primarily on **personal installment loans** — the type most commonly available through online lending platforms like FundingZest. You can [browse available loan amounts](/borrow) to see what options fit your needs.

## Installment Loan Costs

The cost of an installment loan depends on three primary factors: the **APR**, the **loan amount**, and the **repayment term**. Some lenders also charge an **origination fee** (typically 1% to 10% of the loan amount), which is deducted from your disbursed funds or added to the balance.

### APR Ranges by Credit Tier

APRs vary significantly based on your creditworthiness. Here are typical ranges for personal installment loans in 2026:

| Credit Tier | Credit Score Range | Typical APR Range |
|---|---|---|
| Excellent | 750+ | 6% – 12% |
| Good | 670 – 749 | 12% – 24% |
| Fair | 580 – 669 | 24% – 36% |
| Poor | Below 580 | 36% – 199% |

Borrowers with excellent credit get the most favorable terms. If your credit is fair or poor, you will pay considerably more in interest, but an installment loan may still be far cheaper than alternatives like [payday loans](/loans/payday).

### Example Costs: $3,000 Loan at Different APRs

The following table shows the estimated monthly payment and total cost for a **$3,000 loan** at various APR levels over 12-month and 24-month terms.

| APR | 12-Month Payment | 12-Month Total Cost | 24-Month Payment | 24-Month Total Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 10% | $264 | $3,168 | $138 | $3,318 |
| 24% | $284 | $3,407 | $159 | $3,810 |
| 36% | $303 | $3,636 | $179 | $4,290 |
| 72% | $346 | $4,155 | $219 | $5,264 |
| 150% | $440 | $5,284 | $315 | $7,553 |

<StatHighlight value="$2,284" label="Total interest on a $3,000 loan at 150% APR / 12 months" icon="warning" variant="red" />

As these numbers illustrate, both a higher APR and a longer term increase the total amount you pay. A 36% APR loan over 12 months costs $636 in interest. The same loan at 150% APR costs $2,284 in interest — more than three times as much. Extending the term to 24 months at 36% APR nearly doubles the interest cost to $1,290.

Understanding APR is critical. Read our detailed guide on [understanding APR for small-dollar loans](/guides/understanding-apr-small-dollar-loans) for a deeper explanation of how APR works and why it matters.

## Installment Loans vs Payday Loans

Installment loans and payday loans are both used for short-term borrowing, but they work very differently. Here is a side-by-side comparison.

| Feature | Installment Loans | Payday Loans |
|---|---|---|
| **Loan Amounts** | $500 – $35,000 | $100 – $1,000 |
| **Repayment Term** | 3 – 60 months | 2 – 4 weeks |
| **Repayment Structure** | Equal monthly payments | Single lump-sum payment |
| **Typical APR** | 6% – 199% | 200% – 780% |
| **Credit Check** | Soft or hard inquiry | Often none |
| **Credit Building** | Yes (most lenders report to bureaus) | Rarely |
| **State Availability** | Varies by lender and state | Banned or restricted in many states |
| **Best For** | Larger expenses, building credit, predictable budgeting | Very small, very short-term emergencies |

<ComparisonRow title="Installment Loan vs Payday Loan" options={[
  { title: "Installment Loan", variant: "green", recommended: true, stats: [{ label: "Typical APR", value: "6%–199%" }, { label: "Term", value: "3–60 months" }, { label: "Builds credit", value: "Yes" }] },
  { title: "Payday Loan", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "Typical APR", value: "200%–780%" }, { label: "Term", value: "2–4 weeks" }, { label: "Builds credit", value: "Rarely" }] }
]} />

The most significant differences are **cost** and **repayment structure**. Installment loans spread the repayment over months, making each payment manageable. Payday loans require you to repay the entire balance plus fees on your next payday, which can trigger a cycle of reborrowing if you cannot afford the lump sum.

## How to Qualify for an Installment Loan

Qualification requirements vary by lender, but most online installment lenders evaluate the following factors.

### Income

You need a **regular source of income** to demonstrate your ability to repay the loan. This can come from employment, self-employment, government benefits, retirement income, or other verifiable sources. Many lenders require a minimum monthly income of $1,000 to $1,500, though some have lower thresholds.

### Credit Score

Traditional banks and credit unions typically require a credit score of **670 or higher**. Online lenders often accept borrowers with scores as low as **580**, and some specialize in lending to borrowers with poor credit or thin credit files. A higher score qualifies you for lower APRs.

If you do not know your score, you can request a free credit report at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/).

### Debt-to-Income Ratio

Your **debt-to-income ratio (DTI)** measures how much of your monthly gross income goes toward debt payments. Most lenders prefer a DTI of **40% or below**. If your DTI is too high, a lender may decline your application or offer a smaller loan amount. Paying down existing debt before applying can improve your DTI and your chances of approval.

### Employment and Bank Account

Most lenders require that you have an **active checking account** in your name for fund disbursement and payment collection. Some lenders also require a minimum employment tenure (for example, 90 days at your current job), though this varies.

### State Regulations

Lending laws vary by state. Some states cap APRs, limit loan amounts, or impose other restrictions. Check [state-specific regulations](/states) to understand what applies where you live.

## How to Choose the Best Installment Loan

Not all installment loans are created equal. Here are the key factors to compare when evaluating offers.

### Compare APRs, Not Just Monthly Payments

The **APR** is the most reliable measure of a loan's cost because it includes the interest rate and most fees expressed as an annualized percentage. A loan with a lower monthly payment might actually cost more overall if it has a longer term or higher APR. Always compare APRs across lenders. The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) recommends getting quotes from at least three lenders before choosing.

<Callout type="cost" title="Watch for Origination Fees">
Some lenders charge 1% to 10% of the loan amount as an origination fee, deducted from your proceeds. A $5,000 loan with a 5% fee only puts **$4,750** in your account. Factor this into every comparison.
</Callout>

### Check for Origination Fees

Some lenders charge an origination fee of **1% to 10%** of the loan amount. This fee is typically deducted from your loan proceeds, meaning you receive less than the full amount you borrow. A $5,000 loan with a 5% origination fee only puts $4,750 in your account. Factor this into your comparison.

### Ask About Prepayment Penalties

Most reputable online lenders do **not** charge prepayment penalties, meaning you can pay off the loan early and save on interest. However, some lenders do impose penalties for early repayment. Always confirm this before signing.

<Callout type="tip" title="Confirm Bureau Reporting">
If building credit is a goal, verify that the lender reports to at least one of the three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). If they do not report, your on-time payments will not help your score.
</Callout>

### Verify Credit Bureau Reporting

If building or rebuilding credit is one of your goals, confirm that the lender reports your payment history to at least one of the three major credit bureaus: **Equifax**, **Experian**, and **TransUnion**. Not all lenders report, and reporting is what makes your on-time payments count toward improving your credit score.

### Evaluate Lender Reputation

Check the lender's standing with the **Better Business Bureau**, read customer reviews, and verify that they are properly licensed in your state. The [Federal Trade Commission](https://consumer.ftc.gov/credit-loans-and-debt) provides resources on avoiding lending scams and understanding your borrower rights.

### Look at the Full Loan Agreement

Before signing, read the entire loan agreement. Pay attention to late payment fees, returned payment fees, whether the rate is fixed or variable, and what happens if you default. A trustworthy lender will be transparent about all terms and conditions.

## When Installment Loans Make Sense

Installment loans are a strong choice in several situations, but they are not always the right tool.

### Good Reasons to Choose an Installment Loan

- **You need a larger amount.** If you need more than $500, an installment loan gives you access to higher borrowing limits than payday loans or cash advance apps.
- **You want predictable payments.** Fixed monthly payments make it easier to budget. You know exactly what you owe each month and when the loan will be paid off.
- **You want to build credit.** Regular on-time payments reported to credit bureaus strengthen your credit profile over time. This can help you qualify for better rates in the future.
- **You need time to repay.** Repayment terms of 3 to 60 months give you flexibility to choose a payment that fits your budget, rather than repaying everything at once.
- **You are consolidating debt.** Combining multiple high-interest debts into a single installment loan with a lower APR can reduce your total interest costs and simplify your monthly payments.

### When an Installment Loan May Not Be Ideal

- **You need a very small amount for a very short time.** If you only need $100 to $200 until your next paycheck and can repay on time without difficulty, a cash advance app or borrowing from family may be simpler and cheaper.
- **You cannot afford monthly payments.** Taking on a new loan when your budget is already stretched thin can lead to missed payments, additional fees, and credit damage. Make sure the monthly payment is genuinely affordable before borrowing.
- **You are using debt to fund ongoing spending gaps.** If you find yourself borrowing repeatedly to cover basic expenses, a loan addresses the symptom but not the underlying budget shortfall. Consider speaking with a nonprofit credit counselor about longer-term solutions.
