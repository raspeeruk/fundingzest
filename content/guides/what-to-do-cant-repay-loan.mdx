  - question: "What happens if I stop paying my payday loan?"
    answer: "The lender will attempt to withdraw from your bank account. If unsuccessful, you may face overdraft fees from your bank. The lender will contact you for payment, may charge additional fees, and can eventually send the debt to collections. In some states, they can file a lawsuit. Contact your lender before missing a payment to explore options."
  - question: "Can I negotiate with my lender?"
    answer: "Yes. Most lenders prefer to work with you rather than send your account to collections. Options may include extended payment plans, reduced interest rates, temporary forbearance, or modified payment schedules. Call your lender as soon as you know you'll have trouble paying."
  - question: "Will my employer find out if I default on a loan?"
    answer: "Generally no. Lenders cannot contact your employer about a debt unless they have a court-ordered wage garnishment. Debt collectors can contact your employer only to verify your employment information — they cannot disclose the debt."
  - question: "Should I take out another loan to pay off the first one?"
    answer: "Generally no — this creates a debt cycle. The exception is refinancing into a loan with a significantly lower APR and longer term, which reduces your monthly payment and total cost. Never use a payday loan to pay off another payday loan."
  - question: "Can I revoke ACH authorization for a payday loan?"
    answer: "Yes. Under federal law, you have the right to revoke ACH authorization at any time by contacting your bank at least 3 business days before the next scheduled withdrawal. This doesn't eliminate the debt, but it stops automatic debits. Contact the lender as well to arrange alternative payment."

Falling behind on a loan payment is one of the most stressful financial situations you can face. The anxiety compounds — late fees pile up, collection calls start, and the problem feels like it's spiraling out of control. But here is the truth: this is fixable. People recover from missed payments, defaults, and even collections every day. The key variable is how quickly you take action.

The worst thing you can do is nothing. Ignoring a missed payment guarantees the situation will get worse. Every day you wait, your options narrow and the costs increase. Conversely, the sooner you act, the more leverage you have, the more options are available, and the less damage you'll sustain. This guide gives you a concrete, step-by-step plan for handling loan repayment trouble — whether you're behind on a payday loan, an installment loan, a credit card, or any other debt.

## Step 1: Contact Your Lender Immediately

This is the single most important action you can take. Call your lender before you miss a payment if at all possible. If you've already missed one, call today. Not tomorrow. Today.

Lenders want to get paid. When a borrower defaults, the lender loses money — they have to absorb write-off costs, pay collection agencies, and potentially fund legal action. All of that is expensive and uncertain. A borrower who calls proactively and says "I'm having trouble but I want to work this out" is a far better outcome for the lender than a borrower who disappears.

### What to Say

Keep it straightforward. You don't need to over-explain or justify your situation. A script that works:

*"I'm calling because I'm having difficulty making my upcoming payment. I want to resolve this and keep my account in good standing. Can you tell me what options are available?"*

### What to Ask For

- **Hardship program:** Many lenders maintain formal hardship programs that offer temporary relief — reduced payments, lower interest rates, or payment pauses. These programs exist specifically for situations like yours, but lenders rarely advertise them. You have to ask.
- **Extended payment plan:** For payday loans specifically, many states legally require lenders to offer an extended payment plan (EPP) at no additional cost if you request one before or on your due date. This typically converts your lump-sum payment into 4 to 6 smaller installments over 60 to 180 days.
- **Modified payment schedule:** If your income timing has changed (new job, different pay frequency), ask the lender to shift your due date to align with your payday.
- **Deferment or forbearance:** Some lenders will pause payments entirely for 30 to 90 days while you get back on your feet. Interest may still accrue, but it stops the immediate bleeding.

Document everything. Write down the name of the person you speak with, the date and time, and exactly what was agreed to. If the lender offers modified terms, request the agreement in writing before your next payment is due.

## Step 2: Know Your Rights

When you owe money, it can feel like the lender or collector holds all the power. They don't. Federal and state laws provide substantial protections for borrowers in financial distress.

### Federal Protections

**The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)** governs how third-party debt collectors can interact with you. Under the [FDCPA](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/debt-collection/), collectors cannot:

- Call before 8 AM or after 9 PM in your time zone
- Use threatening, abusive, or profane language
- Threaten arrest or jail (you cannot be imprisoned for debt in the United States)
- Contact your family, friends, or coworkers about your debt (except your spouse or attorney)
- Misrepresent the amount you owe
- Contact you at all if you send a written cease-communication request

<Callout type="info" title="You Cannot Go to Jail for Unpaid Debt">
Debtor's prisons were abolished in the United States in 1833. Unpaid debt is a civil matter, not a criminal one. If a collector implies otherwise, they are violating the law.
</Callout>

**You cannot go to jail for failing to pay a debt.** This is worth repeating because aggressive collectors sometimes imply otherwise.

### Wage Garnishment Limits

If a creditor obtains a court judgment against you, they can pursue wage garnishment — but federal law limits this to the lesser of:

- **25% of your disposable earnings**, or
- The amount by which your weekly disposable earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage

Some states set even lower limits. And certain income is **completely exempt** from garnishment:

| Income Type | Protected from Garnishment? |
|---|---|
| Social Security benefits | Yes — exempt under federal law |
| Supplemental Security Income (SSI) | Yes — fully exempt |
| Veterans' benefits | Yes — exempt under federal law |
| Disability benefits | Yes — exempt under federal law |
| Child support / alimony you receive | Generally exempt |
| Retirement income (pension, 401k) | Partially to fully exempt depending on state |

### State Protections for Payday Borrowers

Many states provide additional protections specifically for payday loan borrowers:

- **Extended payment plans (EPPs):** States including Colorado, Washington, Illinois, and Florida require payday lenders to offer EPPs — often 4 installments over 60 days at no additional fee
- **Cooling-off periods:** Some states mandate waiting periods between consecutive payday loans to break the debt cycle
- **Rollover limits:** Many states cap how many times a payday loan can be rolled over (some prohibit rollovers entirely)
- **Fee caps:** State laws often limit the fees and interest lenders can charge on late or defaulted accounts

Contact your [state attorney general's office](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) or state financial regulator to understand the specific protections available to you.

## Step 3: Understand Your Options by Loan Type

Your best course of action depends on what type of loan you're struggling with. Each loan type has different mechanics, different risks, and different relief options.

### Payday Loans

Payday loans are the most time-sensitive because they come due in full within 2 to 4 weeks, and most lenders have ACH authorization to debit your bank account automatically.

  { title: "Rollover (Don't Do This)", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "New fees each cycle", value: "Yes" }, { label: "Breaks debt cycle", value: "No" }, { label: "Additional cost", value: "$75+" }] },

]} />

**Your options:**

- **Request an extended payment plan (EPP).** In many states, this is your legal right. Contact your lender before your due date and formally request an EPP. The lender must allow you to repay in installments over 60 to 180 days at no additional cost. Get the agreement in writing.
- **Negotiate a reduced payoff.** If you have some cash available but cannot pay the full amount, offer a lump-sum settlement for less than the total owed. Many lenders will accept 50% to 80% of the balance to resolve the debt, particularly if the alternative is default.
- **Revoke ACH authorization.** If you cannot afford the full withdrawal and the lender won't negotiate, you have the legal right to stop automatic debits. Contact your bank in writing at least 3 business days before the scheduled withdrawal and instruct them to block future debits from the lender. Important: this does not eliminate your debt — it only stops the automatic withdrawal. Contact the lender to arrange alternative repayment terms.
- **Check rollover restrictions.** If your state limits or prohibits rollovers, the lender cannot legally pressure you into refinancing the loan with additional fees. Know your state's rules.

For a full breakdown of payday loan mechanics, see our guide on [how payday loans work](/guides/how-payday-loans-work).

### Installment Loans

Installment loans are structured with monthly payments over several months or years, which gives you more breathing room than payday loans — but falling behind still has serious consequences.

**Your options:**

- **Request forbearance.** Many installment lenders offer temporary payment pauses (30 to 90 days) for borrowers experiencing hardship. Interest typically continues to accrue, but it stops immediate credit damage and collection activity.
- **Modify your payment schedule.** Ask the lender to extend your loan term, which reduces your monthly payment. A 12-month loan extended to 18 months means lower payments (though more total interest).
- **Explore deferment.** Some lenders allow you to skip one or two payments and add them to the end of your loan term. This is different from forbearance — the missed payments are rescheduled rather than forgiven.
- **Refinance to a lower rate.** If your credit situation has improved since you originally borrowed, or if you can find a better offer, refinancing into a lower-APR [installment loan](/loans/installment) can reduce both your monthly payment and total cost. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to compare scenarios.

### Credit Cards

Credit card debt offers more flexibility than most loan types because there is no fixed payoff date.

**Your options:**

- **Call and request a hardship program.** Most major card issuers maintain formal programs that temporarily reduce your interest rate (sometimes to 0%), lower your minimum payment, or waive late fees. These programs typically last 6 to 12 months.
- **Balance transfer to a 0% APR card.** If you qualify, transferring your balance to a card with a 0% introductory rate (typically 12 to 21 months) eliminates interest charges entirely during the promotional period. A 3% to 5% transfer fee applies, but this is far less than ongoing interest.
- **Enroll in a debt management plan (DMP).** Through a nonprofit credit counseling agency affiliated with the [National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC)](https://www.nfcc.org/), you can consolidate multiple credit card debts into a single monthly payment, often at a reduced interest rate negotiated by the counselor. DMPs typically run 3 to 5 years.

## Step 4: Explore Free Help

You don't have to navigate this alone, and you don't need to pay anyone to help you. Several free and low-cost resources exist specifically for people in financial distress.

### Nonprofit Credit Counseling

The [National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC)](https://www.nfcc.org/) is the largest network of nonprofit credit counseling agencies in the country. Certified counselors will review your budget, help you communicate with creditors, and develop a debt management plan if appropriate. Initial sessions are free; ongoing services are low-cost (typically $20 to $50 per month for a DMP).

### Emergency Assistance

[211.org](https://www.211.org/) connects you with local emergency assistance programs that can help with rent, utilities, food, and medical expenses. Reducing these costs frees up money for debt repayment. Dial 211 from any phone or visit the website and enter your zip code.

### Legal Aid

If you're facing a lawsuit from a creditor or experiencing collector harassment that violates the FDCPA, free legal help may be available through your local Legal Aid office. Legal aid attorneys specialize in consumer debt issues and can represent you at no cost if you qualify based on income.

### Employer Assistance Programs

Some employers offer Employee Assistance Programs (EAPs) that include financial counseling, emergency loans, or paycheck advances. Check with your HR department — these benefits are often underutilized because employees don't know they exist.

## Step 5: Consider Debt Consolidation

If you're juggling multiple debts with different due dates and interest rates, debt consolidation combines them into a single loan with one monthly payment.

### When Consolidation Makes Sense

| Situation | Consolidation Helpful? | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Multiple high-rate debts (payday, credit card) | Yes | One lower-rate payment replaces several expensive ones |
| Can qualify for a lower APR than current debts | Yes | Reduces total interest cost |
| Struggling to track multiple due dates | Yes | One payment date simplifies management |
| Only one debt, already at a reasonable rate | No | Consolidation adds cost without benefit |
| Won't change the spending habits that caused the debt | Likely no | New credit availability may lead to more borrowing |
| Consolidation loan has fees that increase total cost | No | Run the numbers — fees can eliminate savings |

### How to Consolidate

- **Personal loan:** Apply for a [personal installment loan](/loans/installment) at a lower APR than your existing debts. Use the funds to pay off those debts, then make one monthly payment on the new loan.
- **Credit union loan:** Credit unions often offer debt consolidation loans at competitive rates, even for borrowers with fair or poor credit.
- **Balance transfer card:** For credit card debt specifically, a 0% APR balance transfer card can consolidate multiple balances interest-free during the promotional period.

## What NOT to Do

When you're under financial pressure, bad options can look appealing. Avoid these mistakes:

**Don't ignore the problem.** A $500 debt with a $50 late fee becomes a $500 debt in collections with attorney fees and a lawsuit. The longer you wait, the more it costs.

<StatHighlight value="10 loans/year" label="Average payday loans taken per borrower (CFPB) — the result of the rollover debt trap" icon="warning" variant="red" />

**Don't take out another payday loan to pay the first one.** This is the debt trap. You'll owe more than you started with and still face the same problem in 2 weeks.

<Callout type="cost" title="Avoid Paid Credit Repair Companies">
Companies that charge upfront fees to "fix your credit" cannot do anything you cannot do yourself for free. Many are outright scams. The CFPB and NFCC provide legitimate, free resources.
</Callout>

**Don't pay a "credit repair" company.**

**Don't give collectors direct access to your bank account.** If a collector asks for your bank account or routing number over the phone, decline. Pay by cashier's check, money order, or through a secure online portal where you control the transaction.

**Don't agree to terms you can't keep.** If a lender offers a modified payment plan of $200 per month and you can only afford $150, say so. Agreeing to terms you'll break puts you right back where you started — and you may lose the opportunity to negotiate again.

## If the Debt Goes to Collections

If your debt has already been sent to a collection agency, the dynamic changes but you still have options and rights.

### Your Rights Under the FDCPA

You have the right to **request a debt validation letter** within 30 days of the collector's first contact. This forces them to prove the debt is valid, that the amount is correct, and that they have the legal authority to collect it. The collector must pause all collection activity until they provide validation. Send your request in writing via certified mail.

### Negotiating with Collectors

Collection agencies typically buy debts for 4 to 20 cents on the dollar. This means they have significant room to negotiate:

- **Lump-sum settlement:** Offer 30% to 50% of the original balance to settle the debt in full. Start low and negotiate.
- **Pay-for-delete:** Request that the collector remove the collection from your credit report in exchange for payment. Get this agreement in writing before you pay a cent.
- **Payment plan:** If you cannot pay a lump sum, propose a structured payment plan over 3 to 6 months.

Get every agreement in writing before making any payment. Never pay based on a verbal promise.

For detailed guidance on how collections affect your credit and strategies for recovery, see our guide on [how collections affect credit](/guides/how-collections-affect-credit). For the full default timeline and consequences by loan type, see [what happens when you default](/guides/what-happens-when-you-default).

## Preventing Future Payment Problems

Once you've resolved the immediate crisis, take steps to avoid finding yourself here again.

**Build an emergency fund.** Even a small cushion — $500 to $1,000 — can prevent a single unexpected expense from becoming a debt spiral. Start with $25 per paycheck and increase as you're able. For a practical step-by-step plan, see our guide on [how to build an emergency fund](/guides/how-to-build-emergency-fund).

**Borrow less than your maximum approval.** Just because a lender approves you for $2,000 doesn't mean you should borrow $2,000. Borrow only what you need and can comfortably repay.

**Choose shorter loan terms when possible.** Shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but significantly less total interest. A $1,000 loan at 60% APR for 6 months costs $190 in interest. The same loan for 12 months costs $360. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to compare.

**Budget for loan payments before you borrow.** Before taking on any new debt, calculate the monthly payment and verify that your budget can absorb it alongside your existing obligations. If it's tight, borrow less or explore [alternatives to payday loans](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) that cost less.

## Key Takeaways

- Contact your lender immediately — before a missed payment if possible. Lenders prefer to work with you rather than absorb the cost of collections and legal action.
- You have legal rights: the FDCPA protects you from abusive collection practices, federal law limits wage garnishment to 25% of disposable income, and Social Security, disability, and veterans' benefits are exempt from garnishment.
- Payday loan borrowers in many states have the legal right to an extended payment plan at no additional cost — but you must request it.
- Installment loan borrowers can explore forbearance, deferment, modified terms, or refinancing to reduce monthly payments.
- Free help is available through the NFCC (credit counseling), 211.org (emergency assistance), and local Legal Aid (legal representation).
- Never take out a new payday loan to pay off an existing one — this is the debt trap that costs the average payday borrower 10 loans per year.
- Once the crisis is resolved, build an emergency fund, borrow conservatively, and budget for payments before taking on new debt.
