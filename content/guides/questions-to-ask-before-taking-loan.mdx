  - question: "What is the most important question to ask before borrowing?"
    answer: "The most important question is: 'What is the total cost of this loan?' This includes the APR, all fees (origination, late payment, prepayment), and the total amount you will repay over the life of the loan. The monthly payment alone doesn't tell the full story."
  - question: "How do I know if a lender is legitimate?"
    answer: "Verify the lender is licensed in your state through your state's financial regulator website. Check for a physical address and phone number. Look for reviews on BBB and Trustpilot. Be wary of lenders that guarantee approval, require upfront fees, or pressure you to act immediately."
  - question: "What fees should I watch for in a loan agreement?"
    answer: "Common fees to look for: origination fees (1-8% of loan amount), late payment fees, prepayment penalties, returned payment fees, processing fees, and annual fees. Some lenders deduct origination fees from your disbursement, meaning you receive less than the stated loan amount."
  - question: "Should I ask about the APR or the interest rate?"
    answer: "Always ask about the APR (Annual Percentage Rate), not just the interest rate. APR includes the interest rate plus certain fees, giving you a more complete picture of the loan's cost. Two loans with the same interest rate can have very different APRs if one has higher fees."
  - question: "Is it OK to negotiate loan terms?"
    answer: "Yes. Many lenders, especially credit unions and smaller banks, will negotiate on interest rates, fees, and terms. Online lenders have less flexibility since their rates are typically algorithm-driven. Having competing offers from other lenders gives you leverage to negotiate."

## Why These Questions Matter

Most borrowers focus on two things when applying for a loan: "Will I get approved?" and "What will my monthly payment be?" Those matter, but they are not enough.

The monthly payment only tells you what leaves your account each month. It says nothing about origination fees deducted from your disbursement, prepayment penalties that punish you for paying off the loan early, or variable interest rates that can increase your payment without warning.

Hidden fees, unfavorable terms, and fine-print clauses can cost you hundreds or thousands of dollars beyond what you expected to pay. A $2,000 loan that looks affordable at $185 per month might carry $300 in fees you never asked about. A lender that seems reputable might not report your on-time payments to credit bureaus, meaning you miss the chance to build credit while repaying the debt.

The 10 questions below are designed to uncover the true cost, the real terms, and the potential risks of any loan before you sign. Print this list, save it to your phone, or bookmark this page. Bring it with you — physically or mentally — every time you evaluate a loan offer.

## Question 1: What Is the Total Cost of This Loan?

This is the single most important question you can ask. Not the monthly payment. Not the interest rate. The **total amount you will repay** over the life of the loan, including all fees and interest.

Here is why it matters. Consider a $2,000 personal loan at 24% APR for 12 months:

- **Monthly payment:** $189
- **Total of all payments:** $2,267
- **Total cost of borrowing:** $267

That $189 monthly payment sounds manageable. But the real cost is $267 in interest and fees on top of the $2,000 you borrowed. Now imagine a different lender offers you the same $2,000 at 18% APR for 18 months:

- **Monthly payment:** $126
- **Total of all payments:** $2,272
- **Total cost of borrowing:** $272

The monthly payment is $63 lower, but the total cost is actually $5 more because you are paying interest for six additional months. If you only compared monthly payments, you would pick the option that costs more overall.

**What to ask the lender:** "What is the total amount I will repay, including principal, interest, and all fees?" Get this number in writing before you proceed.

## Question 2: What Is the APR, Not Just the Interest Rate?

The interest rate and the APR are not the same thing. The interest rate is the percentage the lender charges on the principal balance. The APR — Annual Percentage Rate — includes the interest rate **plus** certain mandatory fees, expressed as a single annualized figure.

The federal [Truth in Lending Act](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) requires every lender to disclose the APR before you sign. This exists so you can compare costs across lenders on an equal basis.

**Why this matters in practice:** Lender A offers 12% interest with a 5% origination fee. Lender B offers 15% interest with no origination fee. Without APR, Lender A looks cheaper. But when you factor in the origination fee, Lender A's APR is approximately 17.5% — making Lender B the better deal.

Always compare APR, not interest rate. For a deeper explanation of how APR works across different loan types, read our guide on [understanding APR on small-dollar loans](/guides/understanding-apr-small-dollar-loans).

## Question 3: Are There Any Origination Fees?

An origination fee is a one-time charge that covers the lender's cost of processing and underwriting your loan. It typically ranges from **1% to 8%** of the loan amount.

Here is the part most borrowers miss: many lenders deduct the origination fee from your loan disbursement rather than adding it to your balance. That means if you take out a $3,000 loan with a 5% origination fee ($150), you receive $2,850 in your bank account — but you still owe $3,000 plus interest.

This creates a meaningful gap between what you receive and what you repay. If you need exactly $3,000 for a specific expense, you would need to borrow approximately $3,158 to net $3,000 after the fee is deducted.

**What to ask:** "Is there an origination fee? What percentage is it? Is it deducted from my disbursement or added to my loan balance?" Then recalculate whether the loan still meets your needs after the fee.

Not all lenders charge origination fees. Many online lenders have eliminated them to remain competitive. If you are comparing two offers with similar APRs, the one without an origination fee may put more money in your pocket on day one.

## Question 4: Is There a Prepayment Penalty?

A prepayment penalty is a fee the lender charges if you pay off your loan before the scheduled end date. It exists because lenders lose interest income when you pay early.

**The good news:** Most online personal loan lenders do not charge prepayment penalties. Many credit unions do not either. However, some traditional banks and subprime lenders still include them, especially on longer-term loans.

**Why it matters:** If you receive a tax refund, a bonus, or simply have extra cash, paying off your loan early can save you a substantial amount of interest. On a $5,000 loan at 20% APR over 36 months, paying off the balance at month 12 instead of month 36 would save you approximately $1,100 in interest — but only if there is no prepayment penalty negating that savings.

**What to ask:** "Is there any fee or penalty for paying off this loan early? If so, how is it calculated and when does it apply?" Get the answer in writing as part of your loan agreement.

## Question 5: What Happens If I Miss a Payment?

Life is unpredictable. Before you sign, you need to know the consequences of a missed or late payment — not just hope it won't happen.

**What to ask the lender:**

- **Is there a grace period?** Some lenders give you 10 to 15 days after the due date before charging a late fee. Others charge the day after.
- **How much is the late fee?** Typical late fees range from $15 to $39 or 5% of the payment amount, whichever is greater.
- **Does a late payment increase my interest rate?** Some loan agreements include a "penalty APR" clause that raises your rate after one or two late payments.
- **When do you report late payments to credit bureaus?** Most lenders report to credit bureaus after 30 days past due. A payment that is 10 days late may trigger a fee but may not damage your credit — if you catch it in time.
- **Is there a hardship program?** Some lenders offer temporary payment reductions or deferrals if you experience job loss, illness, or another emergency.

Knowing these answers before you need them gives you a plan rather than a panic.

## Question 6: Does the Lender Report to Credit Bureaus?

If you are going to make monthly payments on a loan for 12, 24, or 36 months, those payments should help your credit profile. But not all lenders report to all three major credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) — and some do not report at all.

**Why it matters:** On-time loan payments are one of the most effective ways to build or rebuild credit. Payment history accounts for roughly 35% of your FICO score. A lender that does not report to credit bureaus means you get none of that benefit — you pay the same interest but receive no credit-building value.

**What to ask:** "Do you report payment history to credit bureaus? Which ones — Equifax, Experian, TransUnion, or all three?" Ideally, the lender reports to all three. At minimum, they should report to at least one.

Some lenders only report negative information (late payments and defaults) but not positive payment history. This is the worst of both worlds. Ask specifically whether they report both on-time and late payments.

## Question 7: Is the Interest Rate Fixed or Variable?

A **fixed interest rate** stays the same for the entire life of the loan. Your monthly payment never changes, making it easy to budget.

A **variable interest rate** is tied to a benchmark rate (like the prime rate) and can increase or decrease over time. When rates rise, your payment rises with them — sometimes significantly.

**Most personal installment loans are fixed-rate.** This is standard across online lenders and credit unions. However, personal lines of credit and some bank products carry variable rates. Credit card APRs are almost always variable.

**What to ask:** "Is this a fixed or variable rate? If variable, what index is it tied to, and is there a rate cap?" A variable rate that starts at 10% but can climb to 25% is a very different product than a fixed rate at 14%.

For predictable budgeting on a personal loan, a fixed rate is almost always the safer choice. Learn more about how these different loan structures compare in our guide on [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers).

## Question 8: What Are the Repayment Terms?

Beyond the interest rate and fees, the repayment structure determines how the loan fits into your monthly budget.

**Key questions to ask:**

- **What is the loan term?** Shorter terms mean higher payments but less total interest. Longer terms mean lower payments but more total interest. Make sure the term aligns with your ability to pay.
- **How often are payments due?** Most personal loans require monthly payments, but some are bi-weekly or weekly.
- **What payment methods are accepted?** Bank transfer (ACH), debit card, check? Some lenders only accept ACH.
- **Is autopay available?** Autopay ensures you never miss a payment.
- **Is there an autopay discount?** Many lenders offer a 0.25% to 0.50% APR reduction for enrolling in autopay. On a $5,000 loan over 36 months, a 0.50% discount saves approximately $40 to $50.

Setting up autopay with a small APR discount is one of the easiest ways to save money and protect your credit at the same time. Just make sure you maintain enough in your bank account to cover the automatic withdrawals.

## Question 9: Is the Lender Licensed in My State?

Every legitimate lender must be licensed or registered in the states where they operate. Unlicensed lenders are not bound by state consumer protection laws, which means they can charge any rate, impose any fees, and use aggressive collection practices without legal accountability.

**How to verify:**

1. Ask the lender directly: "Are you licensed to lend in my state? What is your license number?"
2. Check your state's financial regulator website. Most states have a Department of Financial Institutions or Division of Banking with a searchable database of licensed lenders.
3. Verify the lender has a physical address, a working phone number, and a real website (not just a landing page).

**Red flags that a lender may be unlicensed or predatory:**

- They guarantee approval regardless of credit
- They ask you to pay fees upfront before receiving the loan
- They pressure you to act immediately or "before the offer expires"
- They contact you first (via unsolicited calls, texts, or emails)
- They have no physical address or their website lacks an "About" page with real company information

The [FTC's consumer advice on borrowing and credit](https://consumer.ftc.gov/credit-loans-and-debt) provides additional guidance on spotting predatory lenders and protecting yourself.

## Question 10: What Are My Alternatives?

Before accepting any loan, step back and ask yourself three things:

1. **Have I compared at least three offers?** The same borrower can receive APRs ranging from 8% to 36% depending on the lender. Shopping around — even for 30 minutes — can save you hundreds of dollars.
2. **Have I checked credit union rates?** Credit unions are nonprofit and often offer significantly lower rates than online lenders or banks. Payday Alternative Loans (PALs) from credit unions cap APR at 28%.
3. **Do I actually need to borrow?** Can I negotiate a payment plan with the creditor I owe? Can I wait two weeks and cover the expense from my next paycheck? Is there a community assistance program that could help?

Borrowing money costs money. Every dollar in interest and fees is a dollar you cannot use for something else. Sometimes a loan is the right answer — but sometimes the right answer is finding a way to avoid borrowing altogether.

## How to Use This Checklist

Use the table below as a reference when evaluating any loan offer. Ask every question before you sign.

| # | Question | What to Look For |
|---|----------|-----------------|
| 1 | What is the total cost of this loan? | Total repayment amount in writing (principal + interest + all fees) |
| 2 | What is the APR? | APR, not just the interest rate. Compare APR across offers |
| 3 | Are there origination fees? | Fee percentage and whether it is deducted from your disbursement |
| 4 | Is there a prepayment penalty? | No penalty is ideal. If there is one, understand how it is calculated |
| 5 | What happens if I miss a payment? | Grace period length, late fee amount, penalty APR, credit bureau reporting timeline |
| 6 | Does the lender report to credit bureaus? | Reports to all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). Reports both positive and negative history |
| 7 | Is the rate fixed or variable? | Fixed rate for predictable payments. If variable, ask about rate caps |
| 8 | What are the repayment terms? | Term length, payment frequency, autopay availability and discount |
| 9 | Is the lender licensed in my state? | Verify through your state's financial regulator. Check for a physical address and license number |
| 10 | What are my alternatives? | Compare at least 3 offers. Check credit union rates. Consider whether borrowing is necessary |

Save this table. Bring it with you when you apply for a loan, whether in person or online. The few minutes it takes to ask these questions can save you hundreds of dollars and protect you from terms you did not anticipate.
