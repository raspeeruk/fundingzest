faqs:
  - question: "How quickly can I get a payday loan?"
    answer: "Most online payday lenders provide approval decisions within minutes. If approved, funds are typically deposited into your bank account by the next business day. Some lenders offer same-day funding if you apply early enough, though this may depend on your bank's processing times."
  - question: "What credit score do I need for a payday loan?"
    answer: "Most payday lenders do not use traditional credit scores (FICO) to make approval decisions. Instead, they verify your income, employment status, and bank account. This makes payday loans accessible to borrowers with bad credit, no credit, or thin credit files. However, some lenders may check alternative credit databases."
  - question: "Can I have more than one payday loan at a time?"
    answer: "This depends on your state's laws. Many states prohibit borrowers from having multiple payday loans simultaneously. Lenders typically check state databases to verify this. Even in states that allow it, taking out multiple payday loans is strongly discouraged as it significantly increases the risk of a debt cycle."
  - question: "What happens if I can't repay my payday loan on time?"
    answer: "If you cannot repay on time, contact your lender immediately. Options may include an extended payment plan (required by law in some states), a rollover or renewal (which adds fees), or a negotiated settlement. Defaulting can result in additional fees, collection activity, and damage to your credit report. Some states require lenders to offer extended payment plans at no extra cost."
  - question: "Are payday loans legal in every state?"
    answer: "No. Payday loans are effectively banned or heavily restricted in approximately 18 states and the District of Columbia, including New York, New Jersey, Arizona, and Georgia. Other states allow them with varying caps on fees, loan amounts, and terms. Always check your state's specific regulations before applying."
  - question: "Do payday loans affect my credit score?"
    answer: "Applying for a payday loan typically does not affect your credit score because most payday lenders do not perform hard credit inquiries. However, if you default on a payday loan and it is sent to collections, the collection account may appear on your credit report and negatively impact your score."

## What Is a Payday Loan?

A payday loan is a short-term, small-dollar loan designed to bridge a financial gap until your next paycheck. Borrowers typically receive between $100 and $1,000, repay the loan within 2 to 4 weeks, and pay a flat fee for the privilege of borrowing.

Unlike installment loans that are repaid over months, payday loans are structured as a single lump-sum repayment — the original amount plus fees — due on your next payday. This structure is what makes them both accessible and potentially expensive.

**Key characteristics of payday loans:**
- Loan amounts: Typically $100 to $1,000 (varies by state)
- Repayment term: Usually 14 to 30 days
- Cost: $10 to $30 per $100 borrowed (equivalent to 260% to 780% APR)
- Credit check: Minimal or none — income verification is primary
- Funding speed: Same day to next business day

## How the Payday Loan Process Works

### Step 1: Application

You can apply online or at a storefront location. The application typically asks for:

- **Personal information:** Full name, date of birth, address, Social Security number
- **Employment details:** Employer name, income amount, pay frequency
- **Banking information:** Active checking account with routing and account numbers
- **Contact information:** Phone number and email address

Online applications typically take 5 to 15 minutes to complete.

### Step 2: Verification and Approval

The lender verifies your information, focusing on:

- **Income verification:** Proof that you have regular income (pay stubs, bank statements, or employer verification)
- **Active bank account:** A checking account where funds can be deposited and repayment can be withdrawn
- **Identity verification:** Confirmation that you are who you say you are
- **State database check:** In states that maintain payday loan databases, the lender checks whether you have outstanding loans

Most lenders provide an approval decision within minutes for online applications.

### Step 3: Loan Agreement

If approved, you receive a loan agreement that specifies:

- The exact amount you're borrowing (the principal)
- The finance charge (the fee you're paying to borrow)
- The total amount you must repay (principal + finance charge)
- The due date for repayment
- The APR (annual percentage rate) — required by federal Truth in Lending Act
- What happens if you cannot repay on time (late fees, rollover options)

**Read this document carefully.** Federal law requires lenders to disclose the APR, total cost, and payment schedule before you sign.

### Step 4: Receiving Funds

Once you sign the agreement, funds are delivered via:

- **Direct deposit:** Most common for online lenders. Funds arrive in your bank account by the next business day, sometimes same day
- **Cash:** Available at storefront locations
- **Check:** Less common, but some storefronts issue checks
- **Prepaid debit card:** Some lenders load funds onto a card

### Step 5: Repayment

On your due date, the lender collects repayment — usually by:

- **Automatic ACH withdrawal:** The lender debits your bank account electronically on the agreed date
- **Post-dated check:** If you provided a check during application, the lender deposits it
- **In-person payment:** At a storefront location

If your account doesn't have sufficient funds, you may incur overdraft fees from your bank in addition to late fees from the lender.

## What Do Payday Loans Actually Cost?

Understanding the true cost of a payday loan requires looking beyond the flat fee. Here's how the numbers work:

### Fee Structure

Most payday lenders charge a flat fee per $100 borrowed. The national average is approximately $15 per $100.

| Loan Amount | Fee ($15 per $100) | Total Repayment | APR (14-day term) |
|------------|-------------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| $100 | $15 | $115 | 391% |
| $300 | $45 | $345 | 391% |
| $500 | $75 | $575 | 391% |
| $1,000 | $150 | $1,150 | 391% |

### Why the APR Looks So High

A payday loan APR of 391% does not mean you pay 391% of the loan amount. APR annualizes the cost — it shows what the fee would equal if charged repeatedly for an entire year. Since payday loans are designed to be repaid in 2 weeks, not 12 months, the actual dollar cost is the fee amount in the table above.

However, APR is useful for comparison. It reveals that borrowing $500 for 14 days at $15 per $100 costs proportionally more than a credit card at 24% APR or a personal loan at 36% APR — even over a short period.

### The Real Danger: Rollovers and Renewals

The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) found that **80% of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days**. When you roll over a loan, you pay another fee to extend the due date — but the original principal remains.

**Example of a rollover cycle:**
- You borrow $500 with a $75 fee. Total owed: $575.
- On the due date, you can't repay. You pay the $75 fee to roll over for another 2 weeks.
- After the second period, you pay another $75 fee to roll over again.
- After 3 rollovers (6 weeks), you've paid $225 in fees and still owe the original $500.

This is how a $75 fee can turn into hundreds of dollars in costs. Many states have enacted rollover limits or cooling-off periods to address this.

## Who Qualifies for a Payday Loan?

Eligibility requirements are intentionally minimal compared to traditional loans:

**Basic requirements (most lenders):**
- Be at least 18 years old
- Have a regular source of income (employment, Social Security, disability, etc.)
- Have an active checking account
- Provide a valid government-issued ID
- Be a US resident or citizen
- Have a working phone number and email

**What typically does NOT matter:**
- Your credit score
- Your credit history
- Whether you have other debts
- Your debt-to-income ratio (though some lenders consider this)

This accessibility is a double-edged sword. It means people in genuine financial emergencies can access funds quickly, but it also means people who may struggle to repay can easily obtain a loan.

## State Regulations: What You Need to Know

Payday lending is regulated at the state level, creating a patchwork of rules across the country. Here's what varies:

### States Where Payday Loans Are Banned or Restricted

Approximately 18 states and the District of Columbia effectively prohibit payday lending through interest rate caps (typically 36% APR or lower), making the business model unviable:

Arizona, Arkansas, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Maryland, Massachusetts, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Dakota, Vermont, West Virginia, and D.C.

**If you live in one of these states,** you still have short-term borrowing options — including installment loans, credit union payday alternative loans, and cash advance apps. See our [guide to payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives).

### States Where Payday Loans Are Legal

In states that permit payday lending, regulations typically cover:

- **Maximum loan amount:** Ranges from $300 (California) to $1,000+ (some states)
- **Maximum fee/APR:** Often $10 to $20 per $100 borrowed
- **Loan term limits:** Minimum and maximum repayment periods
- **Rollover limits:** How many times a loan can be renewed
- **Cooling-off periods:** Required waiting time between loans
- **Extended payment plans:** Some states require lenders to offer installment plans if requested
- **Database requirements:** Some states operate databases tracking outstanding loans to prevent multiple borrowing

Check your state's specific regulations on our [state lending laws page](/states).

## Payday Loans vs. Other Short-Term Options

Understanding how payday loans compare to alternatives helps you make the best choice for your situation:

| Feature | Payday Loan | Installment Loan | Credit Union PAL | Cash Advance App |
|---------|------------|------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Amount** | $100-$1,000 | $500-$5,000 | $200-$2,000 | $50-$500 |
| **Term** | 2-4 weeks | 3-24 months | 1-6 months | Until next payday |
| **Typical APR** | 200%-780% | 36%-199% | Up to 28% | $0 (tips expected) |
| **Credit check** | None/soft | Soft or hard | Soft | None |
| **Repayment** | Lump sum | Monthly installments | Monthly installments | Automatic deduction |
| **Speed** | Same/next day | Same/next day | 1-3 days | Instant-next day |

### When a Payday Loan Might Make Sense

- You need a small amount ($500 or less) for a genuine emergency
- You have confirmed income arriving within 2 weeks
- You've calculated the total cost and can repay in full on the due date
- You've exhausted lower-cost alternatives (credit cards, borrowing from family, employer advance)
- The cost of not having the money exceeds the loan fee (e.g., avoiding eviction, keeping your car running for work)

### When to Consider Alternatives

- You're unsure you can repay in full on the due date
- You need more than $500
- You need more than 2-4 weeks to repay
- You already have an outstanding payday loan
- You've used payday loans multiple times in the past year
- You have access to credit cards, a credit union, or an employer advance

## How to Compare Payday Loan Offers

If you decide a payday loan is your best option, compare offers using these criteria:

1. **Total cost of borrowing:** Focus on the dollar amount you'll repay, not just the fee per $100
2. **APR:** Required disclosure that standardizes comparison
3. **Repayment flexibility:** Can you get an extended payment plan if needed?
4. **Funding speed:** How quickly will you receive funds?
5. **Lender reputation:** Check the CFPB complaint database, state regulator records, and BBB ratings
6. **State licensing:** Verify the lender is licensed to operate in your state
7. **Hidden fees:** Ask about origination fees, prepayment penalties, late fees, and NSF fees

## Red Flags to Watch For

Avoid lenders that exhibit these warning signs:

- **No state license disclosure:** Legitimate lenders clearly state which states they're licensed in
- **Guaranteed approval:** No reputable lender can guarantee approval
- **Upfront fees before funding:** Legitimate lenders deduct fees from the loan or collect at repayment, not before
- **Pressure to borrow more than you need:** A responsible lender should not push larger loans
- **Unclear or missing APR disclosure:** Federal law requires this — if it's missing, the lender may be operating illegally
- **No physical address or contact information:** Check for a real business address and customer service number
- **Requests for unusual payment methods:** Wire transfers, gift cards, or cryptocurrency are red flags
