  - question: "What is the Truth in Lending Act?"
    answer: "The Truth in Lending Act (TILA) requires lenders to clearly disclose all loan terms before you sign, including the APR, total cost of the loan, payment schedule, and any penalties. This allows you to compare offers and make informed decisions. Lenders who violate TILA can face penalties and you may have legal recourse."
  - question: "Can a lender discriminate against me?"
    answer: "No. The Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA) prohibits discrimination based on race, color, religion, national origin, sex, marital status, age, or receipt of public assistance. Lenders must evaluate all applicants on the same criteria. If you believe you've been discriminated against, file a complaint with the CFPB."
  - question: "What rights do I have against debt collectors?"
    answer: "Under the FDCPA, debt collectors cannot: call before 8am or after 9pm, use threatening or abusive language, contact you at work if you ask them to stop, discuss your debt with others, make false claims, or harass you. You can demand they stop contacting you in writing. You can also request written debt validation within 30 days."
  - question: "Can I be jailed for not paying a debt?"
    answer: "No. You cannot be imprisoned for failing to pay a civil debt in the United States. Debtor's prisons were abolished in 1833. However, you can face legal consequences including lawsuits, judgments, wage garnishment (up to 25% of disposable income), and bank account levies. If a court orders you to appear and you don't, contempt charges are possible."
  - question: "Where can I report a lender that violates my rights?"
    answer: "File complaints with: the CFPB (consumerfinance.gov/complaint), the FTC (reportfraud.ftc.gov), your state attorney general, and your state's financial regulator. Document everything — save all communications, loan documents, and payment records."

When you borrow money — whether it is a mortgage, a credit card, a personal loan, or a [payday loan](/loans/payday) — you have legal rights that every lender must respect. These rights exist because Congress recognized that borrowers and lenders have an inherent power imbalance, and that without enforceable rules, consumers are vulnerable to deception, discrimination, and abuse.

Most borrowers do not know the extent of their protections. That lack of awareness is what allows bad actors to overcharge, mislead, and intimidate. This guide walks through the major federal laws that protect you, what each one requires, and how to enforce your rights if a lender crosses the line.

## Why Knowing Your Rights Matters

Federal lending laws are not abstract policy — they are practical tools you can use. When you know what a lender is required to disclose, you can spot when they are hiding something. When you know what a collector is prohibited from doing, you can shut down harassment. When you know the grounds for a complaint, you can hold institutions accountable.

Five federal laws form the core of borrower protection in the United States:

1. **Truth in Lending Act (TILA)** — the right to clear, complete cost disclosures
2. **Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)** — the right to fair, non-discriminatory treatment
3. **Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)** — the right to accurate credit information
4. **Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)** — the right to be free from abusive collection
5. **Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA)** — the right to control electronic access to your accounts

Additional protections exist for military service members under the Military Lending Act, and every state layers its own consumer protection laws on top of the federal framework.

## Truth in Lending Act (TILA)

The [Truth in Lending Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/truth-lending-act) is arguably the most important consumer lending law in the country. Enacted in 1968 and enforced by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, TILA's central purpose is to ensure that borrowers can see the true cost of a loan before they commit to it.

### What Lenders Must Disclose

Before you sign any loan agreement, the lender is legally required to provide a clear, written disclosure of:

- **Annual Percentage Rate (APR):** The total cost of borrowing expressed as an annual rate, including interest and most fees. This is the single most important number for comparing loan offers.
- **Finance charge:** The total dollar amount the loan will cost you in interest and fees over its full term.
- **Amount financed:** The actual dollar amount of credit provided to you.
- **Total of payments:** The sum of all payments you will make over the life of the loan — principal, interest, and fees combined.
- **Payment schedule:** The number of payments, the amount of each payment, and when each is due.
- **Late payment fees:** What you will be charged if a payment is late, and after how many days.
- **Prepayment penalties:** Whether you will be charged for paying the loan off early. (Many consumer loans have no prepayment penalty, but the disclosure must address it either way.)

These disclosures must be presented in a standardized format so that you can compare offers from different lenders on equal terms. A lender that quotes you a "monthly rate" without converting to APR, or that buries fees in fine print so they do not appear in the finance charge, is violating TILA.

### Your Right to Rescind

For certain types of loans — specifically, home equity loans and refinances on your primary residence — TILA gives you a three-business-day right of rescission. After signing, you have three full business days to cancel the loan for any reason, without penalty. The lender must inform you of this right in writing. If they fail to do so, the rescission period extends to three years.

This right does not apply to purchase mortgages or to most personal loans, but it is a critical protection for homeowners refinancing or taking out home equity credit.

### Your Right to Accurate Information

If a lender provides inaccurate TILA disclosures — for example, understating the APR, omitting fees from the finance charge, or misrepresenting the payment schedule — you may have the right to recover damages. Under TILA, you can sue for actual damages, statutory damages (up to $1,000 for individual actions or up to $500,000 for class actions), and attorney's fees.

## Equal Credit Opportunity Act (ECOA)

The Equal Credit Opportunity Act prohibits lenders from discriminating against applicants based on any of the following characteristics:

- Race or color
- Religion
- National origin
- Sex (including sexual orientation and gender identity, per CFPB guidance)
- Marital status
- Age (provided you are old enough to enter a contract)
- Receipt of income from public assistance programs
- Exercise of rights under the Consumer Credit Protection Act

### What ECOA Means in Practice

A lender cannot deny your application, charge you a higher rate, impose different terms, or discourage you from applying because of any protected characteristic. They must evaluate every applicant using the same criteria.

ECOA also gives you specific rights when you are denied credit:

- **Right to know why.** If your application is denied, the lender must provide a written notice of adverse action that explains the specific reasons for the denial. Vague statements like "you did not meet our criteria" are insufficient — they must tell you the actual factors (e.g., "insufficient income," "delinquent accounts on credit report").
- **Right to know your credit score.** If a credit score was used in the decision, the lender must tell you the score, the scoring model used, and the key factors that negatively affected your score.
- **Right to equal consideration of income.** Lenders cannot discount or ignore income from part-time employment, pensions, annuities, or public assistance when evaluating your application.

If you believe you have been discriminated against, file a complaint with the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/). Discrimination claims are among the most serious violations a lender can face, and the CFPB investigates them aggressively.

## Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA)

The Fair Credit Reporting Act governs how your credit information is collected, shared, and used. It gives you meaningful control over your credit profile and provides mechanisms to correct errors.

### Your Key Rights Under FCRA

**Free annual credit reports.** You are entitled to one free credit report per year from each of the three major bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) through [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). This is the official, federally mandated source — not to be confused with paid services.

**Right to dispute errors.** If you find incorrect information on your credit report — a debt that is not yours, a payment reported as late when it was on time, an account you never opened — you have the right to dispute it directly with the credit bureau. The bureau must investigate within 30 days and correct or remove information it cannot verify. See our guide on [how to dispute credit report errors](/guides/how-to-dispute-credit-report-errors) for a step-by-step process.

**Right to know who accessed your report.** Your credit report includes an "inquiries" section showing every entity that has pulled your report. You have the right to see this list and to challenge any inquiry you did not authorize.

**Right to place fraud alerts and freezes.** If you suspect identity theft, you can place a fraud alert (requires lenders to verify your identity before opening new accounts) or a credit freeze (blocks all access to your report until you lift it). Fraud alerts last one year; freezes remain until you remove them.

**Right to know when your report is used against you.** If a lender, employer, or insurer takes adverse action based on your credit report — denying your application, charging a higher rate, or rejecting your employment application — they must tell you and identify the credit bureau that provided the report.

**Statute of limitations on negative information.** Most negative information must be removed from your report after seven years. Bankruptcies remain for up to 10 years. No negative information should stay on your report indefinitely, and you have the right to dispute items that have exceeded their reporting period. For more detail, see our guide on [how collections affect credit](/guides/how-collections-affect-credit).

## Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)

The [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-debt-collection-practices-act) regulates the behavior of third-party debt collectors — companies that collect debts on behalf of original creditors or that purchase debts and collect on their own behalf. The FDCPA does not apply to original creditors collecting their own debts, though many state laws extend similar protections.

### What Collectors CAN and CANNOT Do

| Collectors CAN | Collectors CANNOT |
|---|---|
| Contact you by phone, email, letter, or text message | Call before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m. in your time zone |
| Ask you to pay a debt you owe | Use threatening, abusive, or profane language |
| Report the debt to credit bureaus | Threaten you with arrest or imprisonment |
| File a lawsuit to collect the debt (within the statute of limitations) | Contact you at work if you tell them your employer disapproves |
| Contact third parties to obtain your contact information (once) | Discuss your debt with your family, friends, neighbors, or coworkers |
| Charge interest and fees permitted by the original agreement or state law | Misrepresent the amount you owe or claim to be a government official |
| Negotiate settlements and payment plans | Call repeatedly with intent to harass (excessive calls) |

### Your Right to Cease Contact

You can stop a debt collector from contacting you by sending a written cease-and-desist letter. Once the collector receives it, they must stop all communication except to confirm they received your request or to notify you of a specific legal action (such as a lawsuit). This does not erase the debt, and the collector can still report to credit bureaus and pursue legal action — but the calls, letters, and messages must stop.

### Your Right to Debt Validation

Within five days of first contacting you, a collector must send a written notice stating the amount owed, the name of the original creditor, and your right to dispute the debt. You have 30 days to request written validation. During the validation period, the collector must pause collection efforts until they provide verification. If they cannot validate the debt, they cannot legally continue collecting.

This is one of the most powerful protections available. Many debts — especially older ones sold multiple times between agencies — contain errors. Requesting validation protects you from paying debts that are not yours, that have already been paid, or where the amount is incorrect.

## Electronic Fund Transfer Act (EFTA)

The Electronic Fund Transfer Act protects consumers who authorize electronic transactions, including ACH withdrawals, debit card transactions, and automatic payments. This law is particularly important for [payday loan](/loans/payday) borrowers because most payday lenders require ACH authorization as a condition of the loan.

### Your Key EFTA Rights

**Right to revoke ACH authorization.** You can revoke permission for a lender to withdraw money from your bank account at any time. Notify both the lender and your bank in writing. The lender cannot require irrevocable ACH authorization as a condition of the loan — this is a federal violation.

**Limited liability for unauthorized transfers.** If someone makes an unauthorized electronic transfer from your account, your liability is limited to $50 if you report it within two business days, $500 if you report within 60 days, and potentially unlimited if you wait longer than 60 days. Report unauthorized transactions immediately.

**Right to dispute electronic transactions.** If you identify an error on your bank statement — an incorrect amount withdrawn, a duplicate transaction, or a transfer you did not authorize — you have 60 days to notify your bank. The bank must investigate and resolve the dispute within 10 business days (or provisionally credit your account and complete the investigation within 45 days).

**Right to receive documentation.** You must receive written confirmation of any recurring electronic payment arrangement, including the amount, frequency, and duration. You also have the right to receive periodic statements showing all electronic transactions.

## Military Lending Act (MLA)

Active-duty service members and their dependents receive enhanced protections under the Military Lending Act. If you are currently serving, these protections apply to most consumer credit products including payday loans, auto title loans, credit cards, and installment loans.

### Key MLA Protections

- **36% APR cap.** The Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) cannot exceed 36% for covered products. This cap includes interest, fees, credit insurance premiums, and any other charges — making it an all-in cost ceiling.
- **No mandatory arbitration.** Lenders cannot require military borrowers to resolve disputes through binding arbitration. You retain full access to the court system.
- **No prepayment penalties.** You can pay off any covered loan early without penalty.
- **No requirement to allot military pay.** Lenders cannot require you to set up an allotment from your military pay as a condition of the loan.

These protections are automatic — you do not need to request them. Lenders are required to verify military status through the Department of Defense database. For a more detailed discussion, see our guide on [loans for veterans and military](/guides/loans-for-veterans-military).

## State-Level Protections

Federal law sets the floor for borrower protections. Individual states build on that floor with their own laws, which can be significantly more protective depending on where you live.

Common state-level protections include:

- **Usury laws and rate caps:** Many states cap the maximum interest rate lenders can charge. These caps vary widely — from as low as 17% in Arkansas to no meaningful cap in some states. See [states that ban payday loans](/guides/states-that-ban-payday-loans) for a comprehensive breakdown.
- **Licensing requirements:** Every state requires lenders to obtain a license before offering loans to residents. Unlicensed lending is illegal and loans from unlicensed lenders may be unenforceable.
- **Cooling-off periods:** Some states require a waiting period between consecutive payday loans or short-term borrowing, preventing immediate rollovers.
- **Extended payment plan mandates:** Several states require payday lenders to offer an installment repayment option at no additional cost to borrowers who cannot repay on the original due date.
- **Database tracking systems:** States like Florida, Oklahoma, and Washington operate databases that track outstanding payday loans to prevent borrowers from exceeding state-mandated loan limits.

Check your state's specific protections through our [state-by-state lending guide](/states) or contact your state's financial regulatory agency directly.

## How to Exercise Your Rights

Knowing your rights is the first step. Exercising them when a lender or collector crosses the line requires a systematic approach.

### Step 1: Document Everything

From the moment you apply for a loan, keep records of every communication, document, and transaction. Save emails, screenshot text messages, log phone calls (date, time, representative name, what was discussed), and keep copies of all loan agreements and payment confirmations. If you later need to file a complaint or pursue legal action, documentation is your foundation.

### Step 2: Put Your Complaint in Writing

If a lender or collector violates your rights, contact them in writing — email or certified mail — describing the violation and what you want done about it. A written record establishes a timeline and prevents the company from claiming they were unaware of the problem.

### Step 3: File Regulatory Complaints

If the lender does not resolve the issue, file formal complaints with the appropriate agencies. For detailed instructions on this process, see our guide on [how to file a complaint against a lender](/guides/how-to-file-complaint-against-lender).

### Step 4: Seek Legal Help If Needed

For serious violations — discrimination, significant financial harm, illegal fees, persistent harassment despite cease-and-desist requests — consult a consumer rights attorney. Many take cases on contingency (no upfront cost to you) if the violation is clear and well-documented. Your local legal aid organization can provide referrals for free or low-cost representation.

## Know Your Rights Before You Borrow

The best time to understand your protections is before you need them. When you know what a lender must disclose under TILA, you can evaluate offers critically. When you know what ECOA prohibits, you can recognize discrimination. When you know the FDCPA's boundaries, you can stop collector abuse with a single letter.

Every borrower — whether you are taking out a [personal installment loan](/loans/installment), comparing [payday loan options](/loans/payday), or exploring [alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) — deserves to be treated fairly, informed fully, and protected by law.
