  - question: "Can I get a loan without a Social Security number?"
    answer: "Some lenders accept an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) instead of a Social Security number. Credit unions, CDFIs, and some online lenders are most likely to accept ITIN. You can apply for an ITIN through the IRS using Form W-7, even if you're not eligible for a Social Security number."
  - question: "Does my credit history from another country transfer to the US?"
    answer: "No. US credit bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion) do not import credit history from other countries. You start with no US credit history regardless of your credit standing in your home country. However, some lenders like Nova Credit can access international credit reports from certain countries to supplement your application."
  - question: "How can immigrants build credit in the US?"
    answer: "Start with: a secured credit card (requires a deposit, no credit history needed), a credit-builder loan from a credit union or CDFI, becoming an authorized user on someone else's card, or using Experian Boost to add utility payments. Most immigrants can establish a credit score within 3-6 months."
  - question: "What documents do I need to apply for a loan?"
    answer: "Requirements vary by lender but typically include: government-issued ID (passport, state ID, or driver's license), SSN or ITIN, proof of income (pay stubs, tax returns, or bank statements), proof of address (utility bill, lease agreement), and visa/immigration documentation (for non-citizens)."
  - question: "Are there special loan programs for immigrants?"
    answer: "Yes. CDFIs (Community Development Financial Institutions) and some credit unions offer programs specifically designed for immigrants and underserved communities. These may accept ITIN, offer financial education in multiple languages, and have more flexible documentation requirements. The SBA also has resources for immigrant entrepreneurs."

Moving to a new country means rebuilding nearly everything — your professional network, your daily routines, and your financial identity. One of the most frustrating parts of starting over in the United States is discovering that your credit history does not follow you. You may have had excellent credit in your home country, owned property, run a business, and managed debt responsibly for decades. None of that matters to a US lender. As far as the American credit system is concerned, you are starting from zero.

This creates a real problem. Without a US credit history, getting approved for a loan — whether for a car, an apartment deposit, an emergency, or a business — is difficult and expensive. But the system is navigable. Millions of immigrants build credit and access lending every year, and this guide shows you how to do it efficiently, what documentation you need, which lenders are most likely to work with newcomers, and which pitfalls to avoid.

## The Challenge: Starting from Zero

The US credit system is built on three credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — that collect data on borrowing and repayment activity exclusively within the United States. These bureaus do not import data from other countries. A perfect credit history in Mexico, India, the Philippines, Nigeria, or Germany does not appear on a US credit report.

This means that as a new immigrant, you face several interconnected challenges:

- **No credit score.** Without at least six months of US credit activity, the FICO scoring model cannot generate a score for you. Lenders who rely on credit scores will either deny your application or offer terms reserved for the highest-risk borrowers.
- **Limited documentation.** Some lenders require a Social Security number, US-issued identification, and proof of income in formats you may not yet have.
- **Unfamiliar system.** The US banking and lending system works differently from what you may be accustomed to. Practices that are standard in other countries — cash-based transactions, informal lending, employer-facilitated banking — do not build US credit.
- **Language barriers.** Financial documents, loan agreements, and regulatory disclosures are complex even for native English speakers. Navigating them in a second language increases the risk of misunderstanding terms.

The good news: each of these challenges has a specific solution, and you can make meaningful progress within months, not years.

## Building US Credit History

This is your first priority. Without a credit history, your loan options are limited and expensive. With even six months of positive credit activity, your options expand dramatically. Here are five strategies, ordered from most accessible to most specialized:

### 1. Get a Secured Credit Card

A secured credit card is the most reliable entry point into the US credit system for immigrants. You provide a refundable cash deposit — typically $200 to $500 — which becomes your credit limit. The card works like any other credit card, and your payment activity is reported to the credit bureaus each month.

**Why it works for immigrants:** Secured cards have minimal approval requirements. Most do not require a credit score or credit history. Many accept ITIN in addition to SSN. The deposit eliminates the lender's risk, making approval straightforward.

**How to use it effectively:**
- Use the card for one or two small, recurring purchases each month
- Pay the balance in full before the due date every month without exception
- Set up autopay for the full balance
- Keep utilization below 30% of your credit limit

Most secured cardholders see a credit score appear within 3 to 6 months and graduate to an unsecured card within 12 months.

### 2. Open a Credit-Builder Loan

A [credit-builder loan](/guides/credit-builder-loans) holds the loan amount in a locked savings account while you make monthly payments. Each payment is reported to the credit bureaus. When the loan term ends, the savings are released to you — so you build credit and savings simultaneously.

Credit unions and online lenders like Self offer credit-builder loans with amounts of $300 to $1,000, terms of 6 to 24 months, and APRs between 5% and 16%. The total interest cost is modest — a $500 loan at 10% over 12 months costs approximately $26 in interest.

### 3. Use Experian Boost

Experian Boost is a free service that adds your utility, phone, and streaming service payments to your Experian credit report. These are bills you are already paying — Boost ensures you get credit for them. The average user sees a 13-point score increase, which is meaningful when you are building from zero.

Sign up for a free Experian account, connect your bank account, and select which payments to include. The effect is immediate. Note that Experian Boost only impacts your Experian report, not Equifax or TransUnion.

### 4. Become an Authorized User

If you have a family member or trusted friend in the US with a credit card in good standing, they can add you as an authorized user. Their card's payment history will appear on your credit report, giving you an instant foundation. You do not need to use the card or even have access to it — the credit-building benefit comes from the account appearing on your report.

This strategy is especially effective if the primary cardholder has a long history, on-time payments, and low utilization. For a full walkthrough, see our guide on [how to build credit from scratch](/guides/how-to-build-credit-from-scratch).

### 5. Use Nova Credit for International Credit Transfer

Nova Credit is a service that accesses credit reports from bureaus in select countries — including India, Mexico, Brazil, South Korea, the Philippines, Canada, Australia, the United Kingdom, and others — and translates that data into a format US lenders can use. This does not transfer your score directly, but it gives participating lenders access to your international credit history as part of their evaluation.

Not all lenders accept Nova Credit reports, but the list is growing. This is particularly useful for mortgage applications and credit card applications where your international track record can supplement a thin US file.

**Timeline for building credit:**

| Timeframe | Action | Expected Result |
|---|---|---|
| Month 1 | Open secured credit card, apply for credit-builder loan, activate Experian Boost | Accounts established, payments reporting |
| Month 3-6 | Consistent on-time payments on all accounts | Credit score appears (typically 580-650 range) |
| Month 6-12 | Continue building; add second credit account if only one exists | Score improves to 650-700 range |
| Month 12-24 | Sustained positive history; secured card may graduate to unsecured | Score reaches 670-720+ ("Good" to "Very Good") |

## Documentation You Will Need

Different lenders require different documents, but the table below covers what you should have ready when applying for any type of loan or credit product in the US:

| Document | What It Is | How to Get It |
|---|---|---|
| Social Security Number (SSN) | 9-digit number issued to US citizens and authorized workers | Apply at your local Social Security Administration office with work authorization documents |
| Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) | 9-digit tax processing number for those not eligible for SSN | Apply using [IRS Form W-7](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/individual-taxpayer-identification-number) with your federal tax return |
| Government-Issued ID | Passport, state-issued driver's license, or state ID card | Passport from home country is accepted by many lenders; state ID requires a visit to the DMV |
| Proof of Income | Pay stubs (at least 2 recent), W-2 forms, tax returns, or bank statements showing regular deposits | From your employer, the IRS, or your bank |
| Proof of Address | Utility bill, lease agreement, or bank statement showing your US address | From your landlord, utility provider, or bank |
| Visa/Immigration Documentation | Visa, green card, Employment Authorization Document (EAD), or other status documentation | From USCIS or your immigration attorney |

**Key point:** If you do not have an SSN, an ITIN serves as your tax identification number and is accepted by many (though not all) lenders. You can apply for an ITIN regardless of immigration status. The IRS does not share ITIN applicant information with immigration enforcement.

## ITIN Lending

An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a tax processing number issued by the IRS to individuals who need to file US taxes but are not eligible for a Social Security number. This includes many immigrants, regardless of immigration status.

**How to apply for an ITIN:**
- Complete IRS Form W-7 and submit it with your federal tax return
- Include original identification documents (passport) or certified copies
- You can submit by mail, through an IRS-authorized Certifying Acceptance Agent (CAA), or at an IRS Taxpayer Assistance Center
- Processing takes 7 to 11 weeks

**Which lenders accept ITIN:**
- **Credit unions** are the most likely to accept ITIN for loan applications. Many credit unions in areas with large immigrant populations have specific ITIN lending programs.
- **CDFIs (Community Development Financial Institutions)** are designed to serve underserved communities and frequently accept ITIN.
- **Some online lenders** use alternative data and may accept ITIN, though this varies by lender and loan type.
- **Most traditional banks** require an SSN and do not accept ITIN for loan applications, though some accept ITIN for deposit accounts.

**Limitations:** ITIN lending products may have slightly higher interest rates than SSN-based products because lenders have less data to assess risk. However, the rates are substantially better than what you would pay from predatory lenders who target immigrants without documentation.

## Best Lender Types for Immigrants

Not all lenders are equally accessible to newcomers. Here is where to focus your efforts, from most immigrant-friendly to least:

### Credit Unions

Credit unions are member-owned financial cooperatives, and many have explicit missions to serve their communities — including immigrant communities. Advantages for immigrants include:

- Most likely to offer ITIN lending programs
- Relationship-based underwriting (they consider your full financial picture, not just a credit score)
- Often provide free financial education, sometimes in Spanish, Mandarin, Vietnamese, and other languages
- Lower fees and better rates than payday lenders or high-interest online lenders
- Some offer secured loans using your savings as collateral

**How to join:** Many credit unions have broad eligibility requirements — living or working in a certain area, being employed by a specific employer group, or joining an affiliated organization. Find one at [MyCreditUnion.gov](https://www.mycreditunion.gov) or ask at your local branch.

### CDFIs (Community Development Financial Institutions)

CDFIs are private financial institutions specifically certified to serve low-income and underserved communities. They are often the best option for immigrants who are still establishing themselves:

- Flexible documentation requirements
- May accept ITIN without additional barriers
- Often offer multilingual services and culturally competent staff
- Financial education and coaching as part of the lending relationship
- Loan products designed for credit building

Find a CDFI near you through the [CDFI Fund](https://www.cdfifund.gov/) or by calling [211](https://www.211.org/).

### Online Lenders

Some online lenders use alternative data — bank account activity, employment verification, education, and income patterns — rather than relying solely on credit scores. This can work in your favor if you have steady income but no US credit history.

Advantages: faster application process, accessible from anywhere, and some specifically market to newcomers. However, verify that any online lender is licensed in your state before sharing personal information. Our guide on [how to avoid predatory lenders](/guides/how-to-avoid-predatory-lenders) explains the verification steps.

### Traditional Banks

Major banks have the strictest documentation requirements and are the least flexible for immigrants without established credit. However, opening a checking or savings account at a major bank — which is possible with a passport and ITIN at many institutions — starts a banking relationship that can help with future loan applications. Some banks offer secured credit cards that can be your entry point.

## International Credit Transfer

Nova Credit partners with credit bureaus in a growing number of countries to make international credit data available to US lenders. This does not replace building US credit, but it can supplement your application.

**Countries currently supported** include India, Mexico, Brazil, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Korea, the Philippines, Australia, Nigeria, Kenya, the Dominican Republic, and others. The list expands regularly.

**How it works:** When you apply with a participating US lender, Nova Credit pulls your credit report from your home country's bureau and translates it into a format the US lender can evaluate alongside (or in place of) a US credit report. You do not need to do anything separately — the lender initiates the pull as part of their application process.

This is particularly valuable for mortgage applications, where your long history of responsible borrowing in another country can make the difference between approval and denial.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

Immigrants are disproportionately targeted by predatory lenders and financial scams. Protect yourself by knowing what to watch for:

**Predatory payday lenders.** Storefronts in immigrant neighborhoods often market aggressively in multiple languages. Payday loans charge $15 to $30 per $100 borrowed (391% to 780% APR) and trap borrowers in rollover cycles. If you need a small emergency loan, a credit union or [installment loan](/loans/installment) is almost always a better choice.

**Remittance-linked lending scams.** Some operations combine money transfer services with high-interest loans, using your remittance patterns as leverage. Keep your remittance services and borrowing separate.

**"Guaranteed approval" scams.** No legitimate lender guarantees approval before reviewing your application. If someone promises guaranteed approval regardless of credit or documentation, it is a scam. Read our full guide on [how to avoid predatory lenders](/guides/how-to-avoid-predatory-lenders).

**Paying for free services.** ITIN applications, credit reports, and basic financial education are free. Do not pay a service or "consultant" to file your ITIN application (IRS Certifying Acceptance Agents may charge a modest fee, but the IRS itself does not charge). You can check your credit score for free — see our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free).

**Unlicensed lenders.** Any lender operating in the US must be licensed in the state where they offer loans. Unlicensed operations — often found through social media, community bulletin boards, or word-of-mouth — offer no consumer protections and no recourse if something goes wrong. Always verify licensing through your state's financial regulator.

**Notario fraud.** In many Latin American countries, a "notario" is a licensed legal professional. In the US, a "notary public" has no legal training or authority. Individuals calling themselves "notarios" and offering immigration or financial services for a fee are committing fraud. Only work with licensed attorneys or accredited representatives for immigration-related financial matters.

## Free Resources for Immigrants

You do not have to navigate the US financial system alone. These resources are free and designed for newcomers:

- **[USCIS Citizenship and Integration Grant Program](https://www.uscis.gov/)** — Funds organizations that provide financial literacy education to immigrants
- **[CFPB Resources in Spanish and Other Languages](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/language/es/)** — Consumer financial education from the federal government, available in Spanish, Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, Tagalog, Arabic, and other languages
- **[211.org](https://www.211.org/)** — Local directory of social services including financial counseling, legal aid, and emergency assistance programs
- **CDFI financial coaching** — Many CDFIs offer free one-on-one financial coaching to help you build credit, open accounts, and plan for major financial goals
- **Consulate resources** — Your home country's consulate may offer financial orientation sessions, legal referrals, and community connections
- **VITA (Volunteer Income Tax Assistance)** — Free tax preparation for people earning under $67,000 per year, available at community centers and libraries nationwide. Volunteers can help you file with your ITIN.

## Compare Loan Options

Once you have begun building credit — even with just a few months of history — comparing multiple lenders ensures you get the best rate available to you. Small differences in APR add up significantly over the life of a loan.
