faqs:
  - question: "Can I get a personal loan with a VA guarantee?"
    answer: "The VA does not guarantee personal loans. VA loan guarantees apply only to home mortgages, and in some cases, business or education loans through specific VA programs. For personal loans, veterans can still access favorable terms through military-affiliated credit unions like Navy Federal, USAA, and PenFed."
  - question: "Does the Military Lending Act apply to veterans who are no longer on active duty?"
    answer: "No. The Military Lending Act (MLA) protections apply only to active-duty service members, including those on active Guard or Reserve duty, and their covered dependents. Once you separate from active duty, MLA protections no longer apply to new loans, though existing loans originated under MLA coverage retain their protections."
  - question: "What interest rate cap does the Military Lending Act impose?"
    answer: "The MLA caps the Military Annual Percentage Rate (MAPR) at 36% for covered credit products. The MAPR calculation includes not just interest but also most fees, credit insurance premiums, and ancillary charges, providing a more comprehensive measure of borrowing cost than the standard APR."
  - question: "Can a lender repossess my car or garnish my wages while I'm deployed?"
    answer: "The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA) provides significant protections during active duty, including restrictions on repossessions and default judgments without a court order. Wage garnishment protections vary by state, but the SCRA generally requires court involvement before a creditor can enforce a judgment against a deployed service member."
  - question: "Are there grants available for veterans who need emergency funds?"
    answer: "Yes. Several organizations offer emergency financial assistance to veterans, including the DAV (Disabled American Veterans), VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars), the American Legion, and Operation Homefront. These grants typically do not require repayment and can cover expenses like rent, utilities, medical bills, and vehicle repairs."

## Why Military and Veteran Borrowers Have Unique Financial Needs

Service members and veterans face financial circumstances that civilian borrowers rarely encounter. Frequent relocations, deployments that interrupt income or make financial management difficult, the transition from military to civilian employment, and service-connected disabilities all create borrowing challenges that standard lending products do not always address.

The good news: federal law provides specific protections for military borrowers, and a network of military-affiliated financial institutions, government programs, and veteran service organizations exists to fill gaps that mainstream lenders leave open. Understanding these resources can mean the difference between a fair loan and a predatory one.

This guide covers every major borrowing option and protection available to active-duty service members, reservists, veterans, and military families.

## The Military Lending Act: Your First Line of Defense

The [Military Lending Act (MLA)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/educator-tools/servicemembers/) is federal legislation that provides active-duty service members and their dependents with critical protections against predatory lending. If you are currently serving, this law applies to you.

### Key MLA Protections

| Protection | Details |
|---|---|
| **36% MAPR cap** | All-in cost of credit, including fees and insurance, cannot exceed 36% annually |
| **No mandatory arbitration** | Lenders cannot require you to waive your right to legal action |
| **No mandatory allotment** | Lenders cannot require automatic deductions from military pay |
| **No prepayment penalties** | You can pay off covered loans early without extra charges |
| **No rollovers** | Payday and title lenders cannot roll over or refinance existing debt |
| **Written and oral disclosures** | Lenders must clearly disclose the MAPR and your MLA rights |

### What the MLA Covers

The MLA applies to payday loans, vehicle title loans, refund anticipation loans, deposit advance products, installment loans, unsecured open-end lines of credit, and credit cards. It does not cover residential mortgages, auto purchase loans, or loans against personal property used as a dwelling.

### How Lenders Verify Military Status

Lenders are required to check the Department of Defense's MLA database to determine whether a borrower is a covered service member. This check happens at the time of application. If you believe a lender failed to verify your status or is violating MLA provisions, file a complaint with the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/educator-tools/servicemembers/).

## The Servicemembers Civil Relief Act (SCRA)

While the MLA governs new loans, the [Servicemembers Civil Relief Act](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/educator-tools/servicemembers/) protects service members on existing financial obligations once they enter active duty.

### Core SCRA Protections

- **6% interest rate cap**: Pre-service debts, including credit cards, auto loans, mortgages, and student loans, can be reduced to 6% APR during active-duty service. You must submit a written request and a copy of your military orders to the lender.
- **Protection from default judgments**: Courts cannot enter a default judgment against you without first appointing an attorney to represent your interests.
- **Lease termination rights**: You can terminate residential and auto leases early when you receive deployment or PCS orders.
- **Protection from repossession**: Creditors generally cannot repossess property without a court order while you are on active duty.

To invoke SCRA protections, contact your lender in writing, include a copy of your military orders, and keep records of all correspondence.

## Military-Affiliated Credit Unions and Banks

Military-affiliated financial institutions consistently offer among the most competitive loan terms available to service members and veterans. Their familiarity with military pay structures, deployment cycles, and PCS transitions translates into underwriting flexibility that mainstream lenders rarely match.

### Top Military-Affiliated Lenders Compared

| Institution | Eligibility | Personal Loan APR Range | Max Loan Amount | Key Benefit |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Navy Federal Credit Union** | Military, veterans, DoD civilians, families | 8.99%–18.00% | $50,000 | No origination fees; deployment accommodations |
| **USAA** | Military, veterans, families | 7.24%–17.65% | $100,000 | Rapid funding; deployment financial counseling |
| **PenFed Credit Union** | Open membership (military priority) | 8.99%–17.99% | $50,000 | No fees; competitive rates for excellent credit |
| **Armed Forces Bank** | Military, veterans, DoD contractors | Varies | $40,000 | On-base branches; military pay expertise |
| **Andrews Federal Credit Union** | Military, DoD, select employee groups | 9.49%–18.00% | $25,000 | Flexible terms; small-dollar loan programs |

### Why Military Credit Unions Are Often the Best Choice

Military credit unions understand that a deployment does not indicate financial irresponsibility. Many offer deployment deferment programs, where payments can be paused or reduced during overseas service. They also understand irregular military pay structures, including hazard pay, combat zone tax exclusions, and BAH, which civilian lenders may misinterpret during underwriting.

If you are not yet a member of a military credit union, joining before you need a loan is strongly recommended. Membership typically requires a small savings deposit, and eligibility often extends to family members.

## Borrowing Options Ranked for Military and Veteran Borrowers

Not all loan types serve military borrowers equally. Here is how the major options rank, from most to least favorable.

### 1. Military Credit Union Personal Loans (Best Overall)

Low APRs, no origination fees, deployment-aware underwriting, and SCRA/MLA compliance built into their operations. Start here.

### 2. VA-Backed Home Loans

For housing needs specifically, [VA home loans](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/) remain one of the most valuable benefits of military service. No down payment, no PMI, and competitive interest rates. Not a personal loan, but essential to mention because many service members take out personal loans for expenses that a VA mortgage refinance could cover at a lower rate.

### 3. Military Aid Society Loans

Each branch has a dedicated aid society (Army Emergency Relief, Navy-Marine Corps Relief Society, Air Force Aid Society, Coast Guard Mutual Assistance) that provides interest-free loans and grants for emergency needs. These are typically small amounts for urgent expenses, including emergency travel, vehicle repair, medical bills, or funeral costs.

### 4. Online Lenders With Military Discounts

Several reputable online lenders offer rate discounts or fee waivers for military borrowers. Verify that any online lender is MLA-compliant before applying. Check reviews, confirm they perform the DoD database check, and ensure they do not require mandatory arbitration.

### 5. Traditional Bank Personal Loans

Available to all borrowers, but rarely offer military-specific benefits. Can be a reasonable option if you have an existing banking relationship and strong credit.

### 6. Peer-to-Peer Lending

Platforms that connect individual investors with borrowers can offer competitive rates, but they lack the military-specific protections and underwriting flexibility of credit unions.

## Veteran-Specific Financial Assistance

Veterans who have separated from active duty lose MLA protections on new loans but retain access to a broad network of support resources.

### Government Programs

- **VA Pension**: Monthly benefit for wartime veterans with limited income and net worth.
- **VA Disability Compensation**: Tax-free monthly payments for service-connected conditions, which can supplement income and improve DTI ratios for loan applications.
- **VA Vocational Rehabilitation (VR&E)**: Covers education, training, and some living expenses for veterans with service-connected disabilities.

### Veteran Service Organizations

| Organization | Type of Assistance | How to Access |
|---|---|---|
| **DAV (Disabled American Veterans)** | Emergency financial grants, benefits assistance | Local DAV chapters, dav.org |
| **VFW (Veterans of Foreign Wars)** | Emergency grants (Unmet Needs program) | vfw.org/assistance |
| **American Legion** | Temporary financial assistance for veterans and families | Local posts, legion.org |
| **Operation Homefront** | Transitional housing, emergency financial assistance | operationhomefront.org |
| **USA Cares** | Post-9/11 veteran financial assistance, mortgage and utility help | usacares.org |

Many of these programs provide grants, not loans, meaning no repayment is required. If you are in financial crisis, exhaust grant options before borrowing.

## Avoiding Predatory Lenders Near Military Bases

Despite the MLA's protections, predatory lenders continue to target military communities. Payday loan stores, high-fee auto dealers, and rent-to-own shops cluster near military installations for a reason: they rely on young service members with steady paychecks and limited financial experience.

### Red Flags to Watch For

- **Any APR above 36%**: This exceeds the MLA cap for active-duty borrowers and is excessive for any borrower.
- **Pressure to sign immediately**: Legitimate lenders allow you time to review terms.
- **Requests for your military ID as collateral**: No legitimate lender requires you to surrender identification documents.
- **Mandatory allotment from military pay**: Prohibited under the MLA for active-duty borrowers.
- **Vague or missing fee disclosures**: MLA-covered lenders must provide clear written and oral disclosures.
- **Rollovers or refinancing of existing debt**: A hallmark of predatory lending designed to trap borrowers in debt cycles.

### What to Do If You Have Been Targeted

1. Contact your installation's **Financial Readiness Program** or **Personal Financial Counselor**.
2. File a complaint with the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/educator-tools/servicemembers/).
3. Contact your branch's legal assistance office for free legal advice.
4. Report the lender to your state attorney general.

## Steps to Get the Best Loan Terms as a Military Borrower

### 1. Check Your Credit Before Applying

All service members and veterans are entitled to free annual credit reports. Active-duty members can also place free active-duty credit monitoring alerts. Review your reports for errors, especially if deployments made it difficult to track accounts.

### 2. Calculate What You Can Afford

Use a [loan calculator](/calculator) to determine monthly payments at various interest rates and terms. Factor in BAH, base pay, and any special pay, but be conservative about income that may not continue after separation.

### 3. Start With Military Credit Unions

Apply with Navy Federal, USAA, PenFed, or another military-affiliated institution first. Their rates and terms are consistently among the best available to military borrowers.

### 4. Compare at Least Three Offers

Even if you prefer a military credit union, getting competing offers strengthens your negotiating position. Compare APR, origination fees, repayment terms, and any deployment accommodations.

For a step-by-step framework, read our guide on [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers).

### 5. Understand Your Rights

Know your [rights as a borrower](/guides/your-rights-as-borrower) under both federal law and your state's consumer protection statutes. The MLA and SCRA provide a strong baseline, but state laws may offer additional protections.

### 6. Avoid Borrowing More Than Necessary

Military life comes with financial volatility. PCS moves, deployments, and transitions create income uncertainty. Borrow only what you need, choose the shortest repayment term you can afford, and maintain an emergency fund alongside any debt.

## When a Personal Loan Makes Sense for Military Borrowers

Personal loans can be appropriate for debt consolidation (especially consolidating high-interest credit card debt into a single lower-rate payment), emergency expenses not covered by military aid societies, PCS-related costs that exceed your move allowance, or vehicle repairs needed to maintain readiness.

They are less appropriate when grant assistance is available, when the expense can wait until you have saved enough, or when borrowing would push your [debt-to-income ratio](/guides/understanding-debt-to-income-ratio) above a manageable level.

If you have explored your options and a personal loan is the right fit, you can check rates from multiple military-friendly lenders without affecting your credit score through a soft pull pre-qualification.
