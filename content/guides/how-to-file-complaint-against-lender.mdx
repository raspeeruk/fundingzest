  - question: "Does filing a complaint actually help?"
    answer: "Yes. The CFPB reports that 97% of consumer complaints get timely responses from companies. Complaints can result in monetary relief, corrected credit reports, and changed business practices. The CFPB uses complaint data to identify patterns and take enforcement action against bad actors."
  - question: "Can I file a complaint anonymously?"
    answer: "The CFPB requires your identity to forward your complaint to the company, but your complaint is kept confidential. State regulators may have different policies. If you're concerned about retaliation, note this in your complaint — retaliation for filing a complaint is itself a violation."
  - question: "How long does the complaint process take?"
    answer: "The CFPB forwards your complaint to the company within 1-2 days. Companies have 15 days to respond and 60 days for final resolution. State regulators may take 30-90 days. If the issue is urgent (imminent repossession, threatening calls), note this for expedited handling."
  - question: "Should I get a lawyer?"
    answer: "For most complaints, you don't need a lawyer — the regulatory process is free and designed for consumers. However, if you've suffered significant financial harm, if the lender violated federal law (TILA, ECOA, FDCPA), or if you need to pursue legal action, consult a consumer rights attorney. Many offer free consultations and work on contingency."

When a lender charges you more than what was disclosed, when a debt collector threatens or harasses you, when you discover unauthorized charges on your account, or when a company refuses to correct an error — you have the right to file a formal complaint. The complaint process exists specifically for these situations, and it works. Complaint data directly drives enforcement actions against companies that violate consumer protection laws.

<StatHighlight value="97%" label="of consumer complaints to the CFPB receive timely responses from companies" icon="check" variant="green" />

This guide walks you through the entire process: recognizing when a complaint is warranted, documenting your case, attempting direct resolution, filing with the appropriate agencies, and understanding what happens after you file.

## When to File a Complaint

Not every frustrating experience with a lender rises to the level of a formal complaint. But certain situations clearly warrant one. File a complaint if a lender or debt collector:

- **Charged more than was disclosed.** The actual cost of your loan exceeds what was shown in the Truth in Lending Act disclosures — higher fees, unexpected charges, or an APR that does not match the agreement you signed.
- **Made unauthorized withdrawals.** The lender debited your bank account for amounts or on dates not authorized in your loan agreement, or continued withdrawing after you revoked ACH authorization.
- **Harassed you during collection.** Collectors called before 8 a.m. or after 9 p.m., used threatening or abusive language, contacted your employer or family about your debt, or called excessively with intent to harass.
- **Discriminated against you.** You were denied credit, offered worse terms, or treated differently because of your race, sex, religion, national origin, age, marital status, or receipt of public assistance.
- **Is not properly licensed.** The lender is not registered with your state's financial regulator and is operating illegally in your state.
- **Hid fees or material terms.** Important loan terms were buried in fine print, omitted from disclosures, or changed after you signed the agreement.
- **Refused to provide required disclosures.** The lender did not give you the written APR, finance charge, payment schedule, and total cost information required by federal law before you signed.
- **Failed to correct errors.** You reported an account error — incorrect balance, payment not credited, wrong account information reported to credit bureaus — and the company did not investigate or resolve it.
- **Engaged in identity theft or fraud.** Someone used your information to open an account you did not authorize, or the lender itself engaged in deceptive practices.

For a deeper understanding of which laws protect you in each of these scenarios, see our guide on [your rights as a borrower](/guides/your-rights-as-borrower).

## Step 1: Document Everything

Before you contact anyone, gather and organize all evidence related to your complaint. Thorough documentation is the difference between a complaint that gets results and one that goes nowhere.

### What to Save

- **Loan agreement.** The original document you signed, including all pages, terms, and disclosures. If you applied online, download or screenshot the loan terms and confirmation emails.
- **All correspondence.** Every email, letter, text message, and chat transcript between you and the lender or collector. Screenshot text messages and online chats immediately — they can be deleted.
- **Call logs.** For every phone call, record the date, time, duration, the name of the person you spoke with (ask for it), and a summary of what was discussed. If your state allows one-party consent recording, consider recording calls (check your state's law first).
- **Payment records.** Bank statements showing every payment you made, including dates and amounts. Highlight any discrepancies between what you authorized and what was withdrawn.
- **Bank statements.** Full statements showing any unauthorized withdrawals, duplicate charges, or transactions that do not match your loan agreement.
- **Credit reports.** If the lender reported incorrect information to credit bureaus, pull your reports from [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/) and highlight the errors. See our guide on [how to read your credit report](/guides/how-to-read-credit-report) for help interpreting what you see.
- **Screenshots.** Any online communications, advertisements, or website pages that show the terms you were offered versus what you received.

Organize these documents chronologically. A clear timeline makes your complaint compelling and easy for regulators to act on.

<Callout type="tip" title="Save Everything from Day One">
Start documenting the moment you suspect a problem. Screenshots, emails, and call logs are much harder to recover later. A well-documented complaint is far more likely to result in a favorable outcome.
</Callout>

## Step 2: Try to Resolve Directly

Before filing a regulatory complaint, give the company an opportunity to fix the problem. This step serves two purposes: it may resolve your issue faster than the regulatory process, and it demonstrates that you attempted good-faith resolution — which strengthens your complaint if you need to escalate.

### How to Contact the Lender

**Put your complaint in writing.** Email is faster; a certified letter creates a stronger paper trail. Include:

- Your name, account number, and contact information
- A clear, specific description of the problem
- The dates and details of what happened
- What you want the company to do (refund charges, correct your credit report, stop unauthorized withdrawals, etc.)
- A reasonable deadline for response (15-30 days)

**Keep it factual.** State what happened, when, and how it violated your agreement or your rights. Avoid emotional language — regulators respond to facts, not frustration.

**Escalate if needed.** If the first representative cannot help, ask to speak with a supervisor or the complaints department. Many companies have dedicated complaint resolution teams that have more authority to offer remedies.

**Document the attempt.** Save a copy of your letter or email, the delivery confirmation, and any response you receive. If the company does not respond within your stated deadline, this becomes evidence of their failure to address your concern.

## Step 3: File with the CFPB

The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/) is the most effective federal agency for consumer complaints against lenders and financial services companies. The CFPB handles complaints about mortgages, credit cards, personal loans, payday loans, student loans, auto loans, debt collection, credit reporting, and bank accounts.

### How to File a CFPB Complaint

1. **Go to [consumerfinance.gov/complaint](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/complaint/).**
2. **Select the product type.** Choose the category that matches your issue — payday loan, personal loan, debt collection, credit reporting, etc.
3. **Describe the issue.** Explain what happened in your own words. Be specific: include dates, amounts, what the company did wrong, and how it affected you. The CFPB shares your narrative with the company, so include enough detail for them to identify your account and the problem.
4. **Identify the company.** Provide the company's full name. The CFPB's system will help you match it to their database of financial companies.
5. **Attach supporting documents.** Upload copies of your loan agreement, correspondence, bank statements, and any other evidence. Do not send originals — keep those for your records.
6. **State your desired resolution.** Tell the CFPB what you want — a refund, an account correction, a credit report update, an end to unauthorized charges, or something else specific.
7. **Submit.** You will receive a confirmation number and can track your complaint's status online.

### What Happens After You File

- **Within 1-2 days:** The CFPB forwards your complaint to the company.
- **Within 15 days:** The company must respond to the CFPB, either with a resolution or an explanation of what they are doing to address the issue.
- **Within 60 days:** The company must provide a final response.
- **Your review:** Once the company responds, you can review their response and indicate whether you are satisfied. If not, the CFPB may investigate further.

The CFPB publishes aggregate complaint data and uses it to identify companies and industries with patterns of consumer harm. High complaint volumes against a company can trigger formal investigations and enforcement actions — including fines and mandatory business practice changes.

## Step 4: File with Your State Regulator

Your state's financial regulatory agency — typically called the Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banking, Department of Commerce, or similar — licenses and oversees lenders operating in your state. State regulators have direct authority over state-licensed lenders and can revoke licenses, impose fines, and order restitution.

### Why State Complaints Matter

State regulators are often more responsive to individual complaints than federal agencies, particularly for issues involving state-licensed payday lenders, installment lenders, and title lenders. They have smaller caseloads and direct enforcement authority over the companies they license.

### How to Find Your State Regulator

Search for "[your state] department of financial institutions complaint" or "[your state] banking regulator complaint." Most states offer online complaint forms. You can also find your state's regulator through our [state-by-state lending guide](/states).

If your complaint involves a payday lender, several states have dedicated payday lending regulators or divisions. These specialized offices are particularly effective because they deal exclusively with the types of issues common in short-term lending.

## Step 5: Report to the FTC

The [Federal Trade Commission](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/) handles complaints about fraud, scams, and deceptive business practices. While the FTC does not resolve individual complaints the way the CFPB does, it uses complaint data to identify patterns, build enforcement cases, and take action against companies engaged in widespread deception.

### When to Report to the FTC

File an FTC report in addition to your CFPB complaint if the lender:

- Engaged in outright fraud or operated a scam (e.g., collected upfront fees and disappeared, impersonated a legitimate company)
- Used deceptive advertising or marketing practices
- Operated without proper licensing or registration
- Stole your identity or misused your personal information

**How to file:** Go to [reportfraud.ftc.gov](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/) and follow the guided reporting process. The FTC also accepts reports by phone at 1-877-FTC-HELP (1-877-382-4357).

## Other Options

Depending on your situation, additional channels may be appropriate:

**State Attorney General.** Your state AG's consumer protection division investigates patterns of abuse and can bring legal action against companies that systematically violate consumer rights. AG complaints are particularly effective when multiple consumers have been harmed by the same company. Search "[your state] attorney general consumer complaint" to file.

**Better Business Bureau (BBB).** Filing a BBB complaint creates a public record that other consumers can see. Many companies respond to BBB complaints because negative reviews affect their reputation. While the BBB has no enforcement power, public accountability can motivate resolution.

**Consumer rights attorney.** If you have suffered significant financial harm — unauthorized charges totaling hundreds or thousands of dollars, illegal fees, discrimination, or persistent harassment — a consumer rights attorney can evaluate whether you have grounds for a lawsuit. Many consumer rights attorneys offer free initial consultations and work on contingency, meaning they only get paid if you win. Violations of TILA, ECOA, FDCPA, and EFTA all carry statutory damages and attorney's fee provisions, making these cases viable for attorneys even when individual damages are modest.

## What to Include in Your Complaint

Whether you are filing with the CFPB, your state regulator, or the FTC, a strong complaint includes the same elements. Use this checklist:

### Complaint Checklist

- **Your information:** Full name, address, phone number, email
- **Company information:** Full legal name, website, phone number, physical address (if known)
- **Account details:** Account number, loan number, or any other identifying reference
- **Timeline of events:** A chronological summary of what happened — dates, actions taken, communications received
- **Specific violation:** What the company did wrong, stated as clearly and specifically as possible (e.g., "The lender withdrew $150 from my account on March 3 after I revoked ACH authorization in writing on February 15")
- **Desired resolution:** What you want — a refund, a corrected credit report entry, cessation of unauthorized charges, an apology and commitment to change practices, or specific dollar amount of damages
- **Supporting documents:** Copies of all relevant evidence, organized chronologically
- **Prior resolution attempts:** Documentation of your attempt to resolve the issue directly with the company and their response (or lack of response)

## Your Rights During the Process

Once you file a complaint, you retain important protections:

<Callout type="warning" title="You Are Protected from Retaliation">
A lender or collector **cannot** retaliate against you for filing a complaint — by accelerating your loan, increasing your interest rate, reporting false information to credit bureaus, or taking any other adverse action. Retaliation is itself a violation of federal consumer protection law and should be reported immediately.
</Callout>

**Right to continued service.** If you have an active loan, the lender must continue servicing it according to the existing terms while the complaint is being investigated. They cannot use the complaint as grounds to call in the loan or change your terms.

**Right to dispute the company's response.** After the company responds to your CFPB complaint, you have the opportunity to review the response and indicate whether it adequately addresses your concern. If it does not, the CFPB can take additional steps.
