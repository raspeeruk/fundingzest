faqs:
  - question: "Is APR always higher than the interest rate?"
    answer: "Almost always. APR includes the interest rate plus certain fees (origination fees, closing costs, etc.), so it's typically higher than the stated interest rate. The only time they're equal is when the loan has zero fees. The gap between them tells you how much fees add to the cost."
  - question: "Which should I compare when shopping for loans — APR or interest rate?"
    answer: "Always compare APR. It's the most complete measure of a loan's annual cost because it includes fees. Two loans might have the same interest rate but very different APRs if one charges higher fees. Federal law (Truth in Lending Act) requires lenders to disclose APR for this exact reason."
  - question: "Why do payday loans have such high APRs?"
    answer: "Payday loan APRs appear extremely high (200-780%) because APR annualizes the cost over a full year, but payday loans are repaid in 2-4 weeks. A $15 fee per $100 borrowed seems small for a 2-week loan, but when expressed as an annual rate, it equals 391% APR. This doesn't mean you pay 391% — it's a standardized comparison metric."
  - question: "What is a good APR for a personal loan?"
    answer: "For personal installment loans: excellent credit (750+) typically qualifies for 6-12% APR, good credit (670-749) for 12-20%, fair credit (580-669) for 20-36%, and poor credit (below 580) for 36%+. APRs above 36% are generally considered high-cost lending."
  - question: "Can APR change during the life of a loan?"
    answer: "Only if you have a variable-rate loan. Fixed-rate loans (most personal loans) lock in your APR for the entire term. Variable-rate loans (some lines of credit, adjustable-rate mortgages) can change based on market rates. Always check whether your APR is fixed or variable before accepting."

## The Simple Explanation

When you borrow money, two numbers describe the cost: the **interest rate** and the **APR**. They sound like they should mean the same thing, but they do not — and confusing them can lead you to choose a more expensive loan.

**Interest rate** is the percentage the lender charges on your outstanding balance over time. It covers one thing: the cost of borrowing the principal.

**APR (Annual Percentage Rate)** is the interest rate plus certain mandatory fees, expressed as a single annualized percentage. It covers the full cost of the loan — interest plus fees like origination charges, closing costs, and discount points.

Here is a useful analogy. Think of the interest rate as the sticker price of a car — the base number before anything else is added. The APR is the out-the-door price — what you actually pay when taxes, dealer fees, and documentation charges are included. Just as two cars with the same sticker price can have very different out-the-door prices, two loans with the same interest rate can have very different APRs.

The APR is always the more useful number for comparing loan offers because it captures more of the actual cost. This is exactly why federal law — the Truth in Lending Act (TILA) — requires every lender to disclose APR before you sign a loan agreement.

## What Is Included in APR?

APR is designed to capture the costs that are guaranteed and known at the time you take out the loan. Here is what goes into the calculation and what stays out.

### Costs Included in APR

- **Interest charges** — the core cost of borrowing the principal over time
- **Origination fees** — a one-time fee some lenders charge for processing the loan, often 1% to 8% of the loan amount
- **Closing costs** — fees associated with finalizing a loan, most relevant for mortgages (appraisal, title search, attorney fees)
- **Discount points** — prepaid interest on a mortgage that lowers the rate (each point costs 1% of the loan amount)
- **Broker fees** — if a loan broker arranges the loan, their fee is included in APR

### Costs NOT Included in APR

- **Late fees** — charged only if you miss a payment; they are conditional, not guaranteed
- **Prepayment penalties** — charged only if you pay the loan off early; also conditional
- **Returned payment (NSF) fees** — charged only if your payment bounces
- **Optional add-on products** — credit insurance, payment protection plans, and similar products

The reason certain costs are excluded is that they depend on borrower behavior. You might never pay late or prepay your loan, so including those fees would distort the APR. However, this means APR underestimates the total cost for borrowers who do incur these fees — which is why you should always ask a lender for a complete list of all possible charges.

## The Math Behind APR

Understanding the basic math helps you see why APR and interest rate diverge.

**Simple example:** You borrow $5,000 at a 10% interest rate with a 3% origination fee.

- Origination fee: 3% of $5,000 = **$150**
- The lender deducts the fee from your proceeds: you receive **$4,850**
- But you owe interest on the full **$5,000**
- Over 12 months at 10% simple interest, you pay approximately $275 in interest
- Your total cost is $275 (interest) + $150 (origination fee) = **$425**
- You paid $425 to borrow $4,850 for one year
- Effective APR: approximately **11.2%** — higher than the stated 10% interest rate

The gap between the interest rate (10%) and the APR (11.2%) represents the cost of the origination fee translated into annual percentage terms. The larger the fees, the wider the gap.

For loans with no fees — many personal loans from credit unions, for example — the interest rate and APR are identical. The moment any fee is added to the loan, the APR will exceed the interest rate.

**The formula in simplified terms:**

APR = (Total Finance Charges / Loan Amount) x (365 / Loan Term in Days) x 100

The actual APR calculation used by lenders follows Regulation Z of the Truth in Lending Act and involves iterative computation, but the concept is the same: take all included costs, divide by the amount borrowed, and annualize the result.

## Why APR Matters More Than Interest Rate

This is where the distinction saves you money. Consider two loan offers for a $5,000 personal loan over 24 months:

| | Loan A | Loan B |
|---|--------|--------|
| Interest rate | 12% | 15% |
| Origination fee | 5% ($250) | 0% ($0) |
| Effective APR | 17.3% | 15.0% |
| Cash received | $4,750 | $5,000 |
| Monthly payment | $240 | $242 |
| Total repaid | $5,760 | $5,808 |
| **Total cost of borrowing** | **$760** | **$558** |

<ComparisonRow title="Which Loan Is Actually Cheaper?" options={[
  { title: "Loan A", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "Interest Rate", value: "12%" }, { label: "APR", value: "17.3%" }, { label: "Total Cost", value: "$760" }] },
  { title: "Loan B", variant: "green", recommended: true, stats: [{ label: "Interest Rate", value: "15%" }, { label: "APR", value: "15.0%" }, { label: "Total Cost", value: "$558" }] }
]} />

If you compared interest rates alone, Loan A (12%) looks cheaper than Loan B (15%). But Loan A has a 5% origination fee that Loan B does not. When you factor in the fee:

- Loan A costs $760 to borrow $4,750 in actual cash
- Loan B costs $558 to borrow $5,000 in actual cash

<StatHighlight value="$202" label="saved by choosing the loan with the lower APR — even though it had the higher interest rate" icon="dollar" variant="green" />

The APR captures this because it rolls the origination fee into the annualized percentage. The interest rate misses it entirely.

This is the core reason APR exists: to prevent lenders from advertising a low interest rate while burying the true cost in fees. When you compare APRs, fees cannot hide.

For a deeper look at how APR works in the small-dollar lending space specifically, read our guide on [understanding APR on small-dollar loans](/guides/understanding-apr-small-dollar-loans).

## APR Across Different Loan Types

The gap between interest rate and APR varies significantly by loan type because different products carry different fee structures.

| Loan Type | Typical Interest Rate | Typical APR Range | Why They Differ |
|-----------|----------------------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Mortgage (30-year fixed) | 6.5% - 7.5% | 6.8% - 8.0% | Closing costs (2-5% of loan), points, appraisal fees |
| Auto loan | 5% - 12% | 5.5% - 13% | Dealer fees, documentation charges |
| Personal loan (prime) | 6% - 15% | 7% - 20% | Origination fees (1-8%) are the primary driver |
| Personal loan (subprime) | 20% - 36% | 24% - 40%+ | Higher origination fees for higher-risk borrowers |
| Credit card | 18% - 28% | 18% - 28% | Few upfront fees, so rate and APR are often close |
| Payday loan | N/A (flat fee) | 200% - 780%+ | Fee-based pricing annualized over a very short term |

**Key pattern:** Loans with high upfront fees (mortgages, personal loans with origination charges) show the biggest gap between interest rate and APR. Products with no upfront fees (most credit cards) show little or no gap.

## The Payday Loan APR Question

Payday loan APRs deserve special attention because they confuse borrowers more than any other number in consumer lending.

A typical payday loan charges $15 per $100 borrowed for a 14-day term. On a $500 loan, that is a $75 fee — you borrow $500 and repay $575 in two weeks. The fee is 15% of the loan amount for 14 days. When you annualize that cost using the standard APR formula:

($75 / $500) x (365 / 14) x 100 = **391% APR**

<StatHighlight value="391%" label="annualized APR on a typical two-week payday loan charging $15 per $100" icon="percent" variant="red" />

That number sounds alarming. But here is the important context: you do not actually pay 391% of the loan amount. You pay $75. The APR is high because it annualizes a short-term fee over a full year — a period 26 times longer than the actual loan term. It is mathematically equivalent to quoting a hotel room's daily rate as a yearly rent.

**So why is APR still the right metric?**

Three reasons:

1. **Standardization.** APR lets you compare a $75 payday fee against a $54 installment loan interest charge against a $425 personal loan cost — all on the same scale. Without APR, comparing a 14-day fee to a 12-month interest rate requires complex manual calculations that most borrowers will not do.

2. **Rollover reality.** Research from the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) shows that approximately 80% of payday loans are rolled over or followed by another payday loan within 14 days. When a $75 fee repeats every two weeks, the cumulative cost approaches the annualized APR. A $500 payday loan rolled over four times costs $375 in fees — more than the total interest on a 12-month installment loan at 36% APR.

3. **Comparison power.** APR makes the cost difference between loan types immediately visible. A 391% APR versus a 36% APR makes it clear that one product costs roughly 10 times more per year. That comparison is much harder to make when one product quotes "$15 per $100 for 14 days" and another quotes "3% monthly interest for 6 months."

For a thorough comparison between these two products, see our guide on [payday loans vs. installment loans](/guides/payday-loans-vs-installment-loans).

## Fixed vs Variable APR

Not all APRs behave the same way over the life of a loan. The distinction between fixed and variable APR affects how predictable your payments are and how much you ultimately pay.

### Fixed APR

A fixed APR stays the same from the first payment to the last. Your monthly payment amount never changes, and the total cost of the loan is known from the day you sign. Most personal loans, auto loans, and small-dollar installment loans carry a fixed APR.

**Advantage:** Predictability. You know exactly what you will pay every month and in total. There are no surprises.

### Variable APR

A variable APR can change over time based on a benchmark interest rate (typically the prime rate or a similar index). When the benchmark goes up, your APR and monthly payment increase. When it goes down, they decrease.

Variable APRs are common on credit cards, home equity lines of credit (HELOCs), and some adjustable-rate mortgages. They often start lower than comparable fixed rates — which is the lure — but they carry the risk of increasing significantly over the loan's term.

**Advantage:** Potentially lower starting rate. **Risk:** Payments can increase unpredictably if rates rise.

### Which Is Better for Borrowers?

For most borrowers, especially those on a tight budget, **fixed APR is the safer choice.** The predictability of a fixed payment makes budgeting easier and eliminates the risk of payment shock. If you are comparing a fixed-rate offer at 18% against a variable-rate offer starting at 15%, the fixed rate may cost slightly more initially but protects you from potential rate increases of several percentage points.

Always check whether the APR on any loan offer is fixed or variable before signing. This information is required in the loan disclosure and should be clearly stated on the first page of the agreement.

If you are on a tight budget and need predictable payments, **choose a fixed APR** every time. Variable rates may start lower, but the risk of rising payments can strain your finances when you can least afford it.

## How to Use APR to Compare Loans

Follow this process when evaluating any loan offers.

### Step 1: Collect the APR From Every Offer

Any legitimate lender will provide the APR in writing before you sign. If they disclose only the interest rate or the monthly payment, ask specifically for the APR. Under federal law, they are required to tell you.

### Step 2: Compare APRs Between Similar Products

APR is most useful when comparing the same type of loan. Comparing a 12-month personal loan APR to a 30-year mortgage APR is not an apples-to-apples comparison because the term lengths and fee structures are fundamentally different.

For meaningful comparisons: compare personal loan to personal loan, installment loan to installment loan. If you are comparing across product types (for example, a payday loan vs. an installment loan), also compare the total dollar cost to account for the structural differences. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to run both scenarios.

### Step 3: Calculate Total Cost

APR tells you the annualized rate. Total cost tells you the actual dollars. Both matter.

**Total cost formula:** Monthly payment x number of months = total repaid. Total repaid - amount borrowed = total cost of borrowing.

Two loans with the same APR but different terms will have different total costs. A $3,000 loan at 24% APR costs $389 in interest over 12 months but $803 over 24 months. The APR is identical; the total cost is not. Always run the numbers for the specific term you are considering.

### Step 4: Ask About Fees Not Included in APR

Remember that late fees, prepayment penalties, and returned payment fees are not included in APR. Ask every lender: "What fees could I be charged beyond what is included in the APR?" A complete cost picture requires this information.

For a full checklist of questions to ask before accepting a loan, see our guide on [10 questions to ask before taking out a loan](/guides/questions-to-ask-before-taking-loan).

### Step 5: Verify the Rate Type

Confirm whether the APR is fixed or variable. If variable, ask what the maximum rate is (the cap), what index it is tied to, and how often it can adjust.

## Your Right to Know the APR

The Truth in Lending Act (TILA), enforced by the [Federal Trade Commission](https://consumer.ftc.gov/credit-loans-and-debt) and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, requires lenders to disclose the APR before you sign any consumer loan agreement. This is not optional. It is federal law.

The disclosure must include:

- **The APR** — expressed as an annualized percentage
- **The finance charge** — the total dollar cost of borrowing (interest + included fees)
- **The amount financed** — the loan proceeds after deducting prepaid finance charges
- **The total of payments** — the total amount you will pay over the loan's full term

These four numbers together give you a complete picture of the loan's cost. They must be presented clearly and conspicuously — not buried in fine print.

<Callout type="warning" title="Red Flag: No APR Disclosure">
If a lender refuses to disclose the APR or provides confusing, contradictory information about the cost of the loan, **do not proceed**. Legitimate lenders comply with TILA readily. Reluctance to disclose is one of the strongest indicators of a predatory lender. For more warning signs, see our guide on [how to avoid predatory lenders](/guides/how-to-avoid-predatory-lenders).

## Key Takeaways

- The interest rate covers only the cost of borrowing the principal; the APR includes the interest rate plus mandatory fees like origination charges and closing costs
- APR is almost always higher than the interest rate — the gap between them reveals how much fees add to the cost
- A loan with a lower interest rate but higher fees can be more expensive than a loan with a higher interest rate and no fees — APR exposes this
- Payday loan APRs (200-780%) reflect annualized short-term fees; the actual one-time cost is the flat fee, but APR is still the best comparison tool because most payday loans are rolled over
- Fixed APR stays the same for the life of the loan; variable APR can change based on market rates — fixed is the safer choice for most borrowers
- Federal law requires every lender to disclose the APR before you sign; if a lender will not provide it, do not borrow from them
- Always compare APR (not interest rate) across similar loan products, then calculate total cost for the specific term you are considering
- Use the [FundingZest loan calculator](/calculator) to see how different APRs translate into actual dollar costs
