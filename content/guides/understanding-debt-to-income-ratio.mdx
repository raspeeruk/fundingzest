faqs:
  - question: "What is a good debt-to-income ratio?"
    answer: "Most lenders prefer a DTI below 36%, with no more than 28% going to housing costs. A DTI below 20% is considered excellent. DTI between 36-43% may still qualify for some loans but with higher rates. Above 43% makes approval difficult for most conventional loans, though some payday and bad-credit lenders have no DTI requirement."
  - question: "How do I calculate my debt-to-income ratio?"
    answer: "Divide your total monthly debt payments by your gross monthly income, then multiply by 100. For example, if you pay $1,500/month in debts (rent, car, credit cards, student loans) and earn $5,000/month gross, your DTI is ($1,500 ÷ $5,000) × 100 = 30%."
  - question: "Does rent count in debt-to-income ratio?"
    answer: "Yes. Rent (or mortgage payment) is typically the largest component of your DTI. Lenders include housing costs when calculating your ratio. If you're applying for a mortgage, lenders look at both your 'front-end' DTI (housing only) and 'back-end' DTI (all debts including housing)."
  - question: "Do payday lenders check DTI?"
    answer: "Most payday lenders do not formally calculate your debt-to-income ratio. They focus on your income level and whether it's sufficient to repay the loan on your next payday. However, responsible borrowers should still calculate their own DTI to ensure they can afford repayment."
  - question: "How can I lower my debt-to-income ratio?"
    answer: "Two approaches: reduce debt (pay off credit cards, consolidate loans, avoid new debt) or increase income (overtime, second job, raise). Paying off your smallest debts first can quickly remove monthly payments from your DTI calculation, even if the balances are small."

Your debt-to-income ratio is one of the most important numbers in your financial life — yet many borrowers have never calculated it. When you apply for a mortgage, auto loan, personal loan, or credit card, lenders use your DTI to determine whether you can realistically afford the new payment on top of your existing obligations. A strong DTI opens doors to better rates and higher approval odds. A high DTI can shut them.

This guide walks you through exactly what debt-to-income ratio is, how to calculate yours, what the numbers mean, and how to improve your ratio if it's working against you.

## What Is Debt-to-Income Ratio?

Debt-to-income ratio (DTI) is a personal finance metric that compares how much you owe each month to how much you earn. It is expressed as a percentage and calculated with a simple formula:

**DTI = (Total Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100**

"Gross monthly income" means your income before taxes, health insurance, and other deductions — the larger number on your pay stub, not the amount deposited into your bank account.

### What Counts as Debt

For DTI purposes, "debt" includes recurring monthly obligations that appear on your credit report or that a lender would verify during underwriting:

- **Rent or mortgage payment** (including property taxes and insurance if escrowed)
- **Auto loan or lease payment**
- **Student loan payment** (even if in deferment, lenders may use 1% of the balance as an estimated payment)
- **Credit card minimum payments** (the minimum due, not your full balance)
- **Personal loan payments**
- **Child support or alimony**
- **Any other installment debt** (medical payment plans, Buy Now Pay Later obligations, etc.)

### What Does NOT Count as Debt

The following regular expenses are not included in a standard DTI calculation, even though they reduce your disposable income:

- Utilities (electricity, water, gas, internet, phone)
- Groceries and food
- Health, auto, and life insurance premiums (unless part of your mortgage escrow)
- Subscriptions and memberships
- Transportation costs (gas, maintenance, public transit)
- Childcare or daycare costs
- Income taxes and payroll deductions

This distinction matters. You could have a "good" DTI on paper while still being stretched thin by high living costs. DTI measures your debt load relative to income — not your overall financial comfort.

## How to Calculate Your DTI

Calculating your debt-to-income ratio takes about five minutes. Here is a step-by-step example.

### Step 1: Add Up Your Monthly Debt Payments

List every recurring debt payment you make each month. Use the minimum required payment for credit cards, not the amount you actually pay.

**Example — Meet Alex:**

| Monthly Debt | Payment |
|---|---|
| Rent | $600 |
| Car loan | $350 |
| Student loan | $150 |
| Credit card minimums (two cards) | $100 |
| **Total monthly debt payments** | **$1,200** |

### Step 2: Determine Your Gross Monthly Income

Use your pre-tax income. If you're salaried, divide your annual salary by 12. If you're hourly, multiply your hourly rate by the number of hours you work per month. Include regular overtime, commissions, bonuses, and side income only if they are consistent and documentable.

**Alex's gross monthly income:** $4,500

### Step 3: Divide and Multiply

**DTI = ($1,200 ÷ $4,500) × 100 = 26.7%**

Alex's debt-to-income ratio is 26.7%. This falls in the "good" range — most lenders would view Alex as a manageable credit risk based on DTI alone.

### Quick Self-Assessment

Use this worksheet approach with your own numbers:

1. Write down every monthly debt payment: ________
2. Add them together for your total monthly debt: $________
3. Write down your gross monthly income: $________
4. Divide line 2 by line 3: ________
5. Multiply by 100: ________%

That is your DTI. If you want a more detailed estimate of what you can afford, use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to model different scenarios.

## DTI Ranges and What They Mean

Not all DTI ratios are treated equally. Lenders use general thresholds to assess risk, though exact cutoffs vary by lender and loan type.

| DTI Range | Rating | What It Means for Borrowers |
|---|---|---|
| Under 20% | Excellent | You are using a small share of your income for debt. You'll qualify for the best rates and highest loan amounts. Lenders view you as very low risk. |
| 20% – 35% | Good | Comfortable debt load. Most loans will be approved at competitive rates. This is where the majority of approved borrowers fall. |
| 36% – 43% | Acceptable | Manageable but approaching limits. You may face slightly higher interest rates or additional documentation requirements. Some lenders set 36% as their preferred maximum. |
| 43% – 50% | High | Limited options. Conventional mortgages are generally off the table above 43%. You may still qualify for FHA loans, some personal loans, or bad-credit lending products, but expect higher costs. |
| Over 50% | Very High | Few conventional lenders will approve new credit. Most of your income is committed to existing debts, leaving little room for additional payments. Debt consolidation or income increases are strongly recommended before applying. |

The 43% threshold is particularly significant because it is the maximum DTI allowed under the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's [Qualified Mortgage rule](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-a-debt-to-income-ratio-en-1791/), which defines the standards for mortgages that are considered safe for consumers.

## Front-End vs Back-End DTI

When you apply for a mortgage, lenders typically evaluate two versions of your DTI:

### Front-End DTI (Housing Ratio)

Front-end DTI measures only your housing costs relative to income. This includes your mortgage payment (principal and interest), property taxes, homeowner's insurance, and HOA fees if applicable.

**Front-end DTI = (Monthly Housing Costs ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100**

Most mortgage lenders prefer a front-end DTI **below 28%**. This guideline is sometimes called the "28% rule."

### Back-End DTI (Total Debt Ratio)

Back-end DTI includes all monthly debt payments — housing costs plus auto loans, student loans, credit card minimums, and everything else. This is the standard DTI ratio discussed throughout this guide.

**Back-end DTI = (All Monthly Debt Payments ÷ Gross Monthly Income) × 100**

Most mortgage lenders prefer a back-end DTI **below 36%**. Together with the 28% front-end guideline, this creates the well-known "28/36 rule" of mortgage qualification.

**When does front-end DTI matter?** Primarily for mortgage applications. Most personal loan, auto loan, and credit card lenders look only at back-end DTI. If you're not applying for a mortgage, your back-end DTI is the number to focus on.

## How DTI Affects Loan Approval

Different loan products have different DTI requirements. Here is a general overview:

| Loan Type | Typical Maximum DTI | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Conventional mortgage | 43% (some exceptions to 50%) | Qualified Mortgage rule sets 43% standard; some lenders allow higher with strong compensating factors |
| FHA mortgage | 50% | More flexible than conventional; designed for first-time buyers and lower-credit borrowers |
| VA mortgage | 41% guideline (not a hard cap) | VA loans use 41% as a benchmark but allow exceptions with residual income analysis |
| Personal loan | 36% – 50% (varies widely) | Online lenders may be more flexible than banks; some bad-credit lenders don't check DTI |
| Auto loan | No hard rule; prefer under 50% | Auto lenders focus more on income sufficiency and loan-to-value ratio than strict DTI |
| Payday loan | No formal DTI check | Payday lenders verify income but typically do not calculate DTI; approval is based on income alone |

Understanding where your DTI falls relative to these thresholds tells you which loan products are realistic options. If your DTI is above 43%, conventional mortgages are likely out of reach — but FHA loans, personal loans, and [installment loans](/loans/installment) may still be available. If your DTI is above 50%, you may need to focus on reducing debt before taking on new borrowing, unless you're looking at products like [bad-credit loans](/loans/bad-credit) that use income-based rather than DTI-based underwriting.

## DTI vs Credit Score

Borrowers often confuse debt-to-income ratio with credit score, or assume that one automatically determines the other. They are related but measure fundamentally different things.

**Credit score** reflects your **past borrowing behavior** — whether you've paid on time, how long you've had accounts, how much of your available credit you're using, and whether you've had defaults or collections. It is backward-looking.

**Debt-to-income ratio** reflects your **current capacity** to take on new debt. It measures the mathematical relationship between your existing obligations and your income. It is a present-tense snapshot.

This distinction creates four possible scenarios:

- **High score + Low DTI:** Ideal borrower. Approved easily with the best rates.
- **High score + High DTI:** Good history but stretched thin. May be denied despite excellent credit because the lender doubts repayment capacity.
- **Low score + Low DTI:** Past problems but current capacity exists. May qualify for subprime products at higher rates.
- **Low score + High DTI:** Hardest to approve. Both track record and capacity are concerning.

Because DTI is not included in your credit score calculation (FICO and VantageScore do not use income data), improving your DTI does not directly raise your score. However, the actions that lower DTI — paying off debts, reducing balances — often improve your credit utilization, which does boost your score.

## How to Lower Your DTI

If your DTI is higher than you'd like, you have two levers: reduce your monthly debt payments or increase your gross monthly income. Here are practical strategies for each.

### Reduce Debt Payments

**Pay off your smallest debts first (snowball method).** Eliminating a $50/month credit card payment or a $75/month store card has the same DTI impact as eliminating any other $50-$75 payment — but small balances are faster and easier to pay off. Every eliminated payment directly reduces your DTI numerator.

**Consolidate high-interest debt.** If you have multiple credit card or loan payments, a [debt consolidation loan](/loans/installment) can combine them into a single, lower monthly payment. This reduces your DTI even if the total balance stays the same, because the payment amount drops.

**Refinance existing loans for lower payments.** Refinancing an auto loan or student loan to a lower interest rate or longer term reduces the monthly payment, which lowers your DTI. Be aware that extending the term means paying more interest over the life of the loan — this is a trade-off.

**Avoid taking on new debt.** Every new loan or credit card balance increases your DTI. If you're planning a major borrowing event (like a mortgage), avoid financing furniture, cars, or other purchases in the months leading up to your application.

**Pay more than the minimum on credit cards.** While your DTI is based on minimum payments, reducing your balances means lower minimums over time. Aggressively paying down credit card debt is one of the most effective long-term DTI strategies.

### Increase Income

**Overtime and extra hours.** If your employer offers overtime, taking it boosts your gross income immediately. Lenders typically accept overtime income if you have a 2-year history of earning it.

**Second job or side income.** Freelance work, gig economy jobs, or a part-time position adds to your gross income. Most lenders want to see at least 12-24 months of consistent side income before counting it for qualification purposes.

**Request a raise.** A higher salary directly reduces your DTI without changing your debt load. Even a modest raise can move you from one DTI bracket to another.

**Include all qualifying income.** Make sure you're counting all income that lenders accept: salary, bonuses, commissions, Social Security, disability, pension, rental income, and alimony received. If you have income sources you haven't included, your actual DTI may be lower than you think.
