faqs:
  - question: "Why do some states ban payday loans?"
    answer: "States ban payday loans because of concerns about predatory lending, debt cycles, and disproportionate harm to low-income communities. Studies show that in states with payday loan bans, consumers use less high-cost credit overall and don't simply substitute other expensive borrowing. The high APRs (200-780%) are seen as exploitative."
  - question: "Can I still get a short-term loan in a state that bans payday loans?"
    answer: "Yes. Alternatives include personal installment loans (available in all 50 states), credit union payday alternative loans (PALs), cash advance apps, credit card cash advances, and community assistance programs. These alternatives typically cost significantly less than payday loans."
  - question: "What happens if I get a payday loan online in a state where they're banned?"
    answer: "Licensed lenders must follow the laws of your state of residence. A legitimate lender cannot legally issue a payday loan to someone in a state where they're banned. Unlicensed or offshore lenders may try, but these loans may be unenforceable, and you lose state protections. Borrowing from unlicensed lenders is risky."
  - question: "Are there any exceptions to state payday loan bans?"
    answer: "Some states allow modified short-term lending products that don't meet the technical definition of payday loans. For example, some allow small-dollar installment loans with APR caps. Tribal lenders may claim sovereign immunity from state laws, though this is legally contested. Always check your state's specific regulations."

Payday lending is not legal everywhere. Roughly one-third of U.S. states and the District of Columbia have either banned payday loans outright or imposed restrictions so strict that the traditional payday lending model cannot operate. If you live in one of these states, you cannot legally obtain a storefront payday loan — and online lenders licensed in your state cannot offer them either.

This guide covers which states ban payday loans, how those bans work, what research says about their effects, and what alternatives are available when you need short-term cash in a state where payday lending is prohibited.

## Which States Ban Payday Loans?

As of 2026, the following states and territories either prohibit payday lending entirely or impose rate caps that effectively make the payday loan business model unviable. The most common threshold is a 36% APR cap — at that rate, the small-dollar, short-term loan structure that defines payday lending cannot generate enough revenue to sustain operations, so lenders do not offer the product.

| State | Status | Method of Restriction | Max APR (if applicable) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Arizona | Banned | Payday lending statute expired in 2010; not renewed | 36% |
| Arkansas | Banned | State constitution caps interest at 17% | 17% |
| Colorado | Effectively Banned | Payday loan reform converted all payday loans to installment structure with rate cap | 36% |
| Connecticut | Banned | Outright prohibition; no payday lending license available | 30.03% (small loan cap) |
| Georgia | Banned | Payday lending violates state racketeering and usury laws | 60% (criminal usury) |
| Illinois | Banned | Predatory Lending Prevention Act (2021) caps consumer loans | 36% (all-in APR) |
| Maryland | Banned | Usury cap makes payday model unviable | 33% |
| Massachusetts | Effectively Banned | Small loan rate cap prevents payday model | 23% |
| Montana | Banned | Voter initiative (2010) capped rates | 36% |
| Nebraska | Banned | Voter initiative (2020) capped rates | 36% |
| New Hampshire | Banned | Rate cap enacted in 2009 | 36% |
| New Jersey | Banned | Usury cap; no payday lending license exists | 30% |
| New York | Banned | Usury cap; criminal penalties for exceeding limits | 25% (civil) / 16% (criminal) |
| North Carolina | Banned | Payday lending authorization expired in 2001; not renewed | 36% |
| Pennsylvania | Banned | Usury cap; payday lending not authorized | 24% (for loans under $25,000) |
| South Dakota | Banned | Voter initiative (2016) capped rates | 36% |
| Vermont | Effectively Banned | Usury cap makes payday model unviable | 24% |
| West Virginia | Banned | Payday lending statute repealed in 2006 | 31% |
| District of Columbia | Banned | Usury cap eliminates payday model | 24% |

**Note:** Lending laws change. Several states have strengthened protections in recent years, and legislation is pending in others. Check your [state's current regulations](/states) or your state financial regulator's website for the most up-to-date information.

### States With Heavy Restrictions

A few additional states allow some form of short-term lending but impose restrictions significant enough to limit the traditional payday model:

- **Oregon** caps payday loans at 36% APR with a minimum 31-day term and limits fees, substantially reducing the cost compared to unrestricted states.
- **Maine** caps rates at 30% and limits fees, making the payday model marginally viable but far less common.
- **Minnesota** allows payday loans but caps fees at $5.50 per $100 for the first $300 and 5% above that, and requires installment repayment options for repeat borrowers.

## How States Ban Payday Loans

States use three primary mechanisms to prohibit or effectively eliminate payday lending. Understanding the method matters because it affects what types of short-term lending remain available.

### Outright Prohibition

Some states simply do not issue payday lending licenses. Without a license, no lender can legally offer payday products to residents. Georgia goes further, classifying payday lending as a violation of its industrial loan and racketeering statutes — making it a criminal offense, not just a regulatory violation.

States using outright prohibition: Georgia, New York (criminal usury), Connecticut, New Jersey, Maryland, Pennsylvania.

### APR Rate Caps

The most common approach is capping interest rates at a level that makes the payday loan business model financially unworkable. A typical payday loan charges $15 per $100 for a two-week term, which translates to approximately 391% APR. When a state caps rates at 36% APR, a lender could only charge about $1.38 per $100 for two weeks — nowhere near enough to cover origination costs, default risk, and overhead.

States using APR caps: Arizona, Colorado, Illinois, Montana, Nebraska, New Hampshire, South Dakota, Arkansas (constitutional cap).

### Sunset Provisions

Several states originally authorized payday lending on a trial basis with built-in expiration dates. When the authorizing statutes expired, the legislature chose not to renew them — effectively ending payday lending without needing to pass a new prohibition.

States where authorization expired: Arizona (2010), North Carolina (2001), West Virginia (2006).

## The Impact of Payday Loan Bans

The question of whether payday loan bans help or hurt consumers has been studied extensively. The evidence is not perfectly one-sided, but the weight of research supports the conclusion that bans reduce financial harm without creating equivalent problems elsewhere.

### What Research Shows

**Reduced high-cost borrowing overall.** A common argument against bans is that consumers will simply turn to other expensive options — credit card cash advances, overdraft fees, or illegal lending. Studies from the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the National Bureau of Economic Research, and the [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/payday-loans/) have found that this substitution effect is limited. Consumers in ban states do use somewhat more overdraft protection and credit card borrowing, but the total cost of high-interest debt is meaningfully lower than in states that allow payday lending.

**No measurable increase in bankruptcies.** One concern was that banning payday loans would push financially stressed consumers into bankruptcy by removing a safety valve. Multiple studies — including research published in the Journal of Law and Economics — found no statistically significant increase in personal bankruptcy filings in states that banned payday loans.

**Debt cycle reduction.** The CFPB's own research found that 4 out of 5 payday loans are rolled over or followed by another loan within 14 days. In ban states, this cycle does not exist for payday products, and there is no evidence that equivalent cycles form around substitute products at the same rate.

**A balanced perspective.** Critics of bans argue that some consumers genuinely benefit from short-term payday access when used as intended — a one-time bridge to the next paycheck. Eliminating the option entirely may leave some borrowers without a timely solution for genuine emergencies. This is a legitimate concern, though the data suggests the majority of payday loan usage is repeat borrowing, not one-time emergency use.

## Alternatives Available in Ban States

Living in a state that bans payday loans does not mean you lack options when you need short-term cash. Several alternatives are available in all 50 states and typically cost a fraction of what a payday loan charges.

### Cost Comparison

| Borrowing Method | Typical Cost for $500 | Equivalent APR | Availability |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payday loan (where legal) | $75 fee (2 weeks) | 391% | States without bans |
| Personal installment loan | $90-$170 interest (6 months) | 36%-70% | All 50 states |
| Credit union PAL | $12-$22 interest (3 months) | 28% | Federal credit unions nationwide |
| Cash advance app | $0-$14 (tip + instant fee) | Minimal | All 50 states |
| Credit card cash advance | $37 (fee + 1 month interest) | 25%-30% | Cardholders nationwide |
| Employer wage advance | $0-$5 per transaction | None | Participating employers |

### Personal Installment Loans

[Installment loans](/loans/installment) are available in every state, including those that ban payday loans. Instead of requiring a lump-sum repayment in two weeks, installment loans spread payments over months. This structure eliminates the rollover trap that makes payday loans dangerous. While APRs vary — from 36% for borrowers with fair credit to higher rates for those with poor credit — the total cost is predictable and the payments are manageable.

### Credit Union Payday Alternative Loans (PALs)

Federally regulated [PALs](https://www.ncua.gov/consumers/payday-alternative-loans) are available at credit unions nationwide with APR capped at 28%. PAL I loans range from $200 to $1,000 with terms of 1 to 6 months; PAL II loans go up to $2,000 with terms up to 12 months. You must be a credit union member, but joining is typically straightforward — many credit unions are open to anyone in a specific geographic area.

### Cash Advance Apps

Apps like Earnin, Dave, MoneyLion, and Brigit provide small advances ($50-$500) based on your income pattern, not your credit score. Most charge no mandatory interest — instead relying on optional tips or small subscription fees. These are available in all states and can fund same-day in many cases. See our full comparison in [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives).

### Other Options

- **Credit card cash advances:** Expensive compared to regular purchases (25%-30% APR plus a 3%-5% fee) but substantially cheaper than payday loans and immediately available to existing cardholders.
- **Employer paycheck advances:** Many employers offer earned wage access through providers like PayActiv or DailyPay. Ask your HR department.
- **Community assistance programs:** Dial 211 or visit 211.org to find local emergency assistance for rent, utilities, food, and medical costs — at no cost to you.

## Online Lending and State Laws

A common question: "If I live in a ban state, can I just go online and get a payday loan from a lender in another state?" The short answer is no — at least not legally.

### How State Laws Apply Online

Online lenders are required to follow the laws of **your state of residence**, not the state where they are headquartered. A lender based in Utah (which permits payday lending) cannot legally issue a payday loan to a borrower in New York (which bans them). Legitimate online lenders verify your state of residence during the application process and will decline applications from states where their product is not permitted.

### How to Verify a Lender Is Compliant

Before borrowing from any online lender, check that they are licensed to operate in your state. You can verify licensing through your state's Department of Financial Institutions, Division of Banking, or equivalent regulatory body. If a lender does not appear in the state licensing database, do not provide them with your personal or financial information.

For guidance on spotting illegitimate lenders, see our guide on [how to avoid predatory lenders](/guides/how-to-avoid-predatory-lenders).

### Risks of Unlicensed Lenders

Unlicensed online lenders — including some operating from offshore locations — may attempt to lend into ban states. Borrowing from these lenders is risky for several reasons:

- **No regulatory oversight.** If something goes wrong, your state financial regulator has limited ability to help.
- **Loans may be unenforceable.** Courts in many states have ruled that loans made in violation of state lending laws are void, meaning the borrower may not be legally obligated to repay. However, relying on this is uncertain and stressful.
- **Aggressive collection practices.** Unlicensed lenders are less likely to follow the Fair Debt Collection Practices Act and may use tactics that licensed lenders would never employ.
- **Data security risks.** Providing your Social Security number, bank account information, and personal details to an unregulated entity creates significant identity theft risk.

### The Tribal Lending Question

Some online lenders operate under the authority of Native American tribal sovereignty, claiming exemption from state lending laws. This is a legally contested area. Several courts have ruled that tribal lending entities must still comply with state consumer protection laws, particularly when the tribe's involvement is nominal and the actual operations are run by non-tribal third parties. If you encounter a tribal lender offering payday loans in a ban state, exercise caution — the legal protections may be unclear.

## What If You're in a State With Payday Loans?

If your state permits payday lending, that does not mean a payday loan is your best option. The alternatives listed above are available in every state, and they are almost always cheaper.

Before taking a payday loan, compare costs. A $500 payday loan that costs $75 every two weeks can become $300 or more in fees over two months if rolled over — while a $500 installment loan at even a high APR of 100% costs about $170 in interest over six months with predictable monthly payments.

If you do decide a [payday loan](/loans/payday) fits your situation, compare offers from multiple lenders. Rates and fees vary, and even small differences matter when the cost of borrowing is this high.

## Find Your State's Regulations

Every state has its own lending laws, rate caps, licensing requirements, and consumer protections. Understanding the specific rules in your state helps you know what lenders can and cannot charge, what disclosures they must provide, and where to file a complaint if something goes wrong.
