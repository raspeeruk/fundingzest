  - question: "How much does a collection drop your credit score?"
    answer: "A new collection account can drop your credit score by 50-110 points, depending on your starting score. People with higher scores experience larger drops. A person with a 780 score might lose 100+ points, while someone with a 600 score might lose 50-60 points."
  - question: "Does paying off collections improve your credit score?"
    answer: "It depends on the scoring model. FICO 9 and VantageScore 3.0/4.0 ignore paid collections, so paying can help if your lender uses these models. Older FICO versions (still widely used) count paid collections the same as unpaid. However, many lenders manually check whether collections are paid, and some require it for loan approval."
  - question: "How long do collections stay on your credit report?"
    answer: "Collection accounts remain on your credit report for 7 years from the date of the original delinquency (first missed payment), not from when it was sent to collections. After 7 years, they must be automatically removed, regardless of whether you've paid them."
  - question: "Can I negotiate with collection agencies?"
    answer: "Yes. You can negotiate the amount owed (settling for less than the full balance is common — 30-50% of the original debt), payment plans, or a 'pay-for-delete' agreement where the agency removes the collection from your report in exchange for payment. Always get agreements in writing before paying."
  - question: "What is a pay-for-delete agreement?"
    answer: "A pay-for-delete is an agreement where a collection agency removes the negative entry from your credit report in exchange for your payment. While not guaranteed and technically against credit bureau policies, many agencies still honor these arrangements. Always get the agreement in writing before making any payment."

A collection account on your credit report is one of the most damaging marks you can have. Whether it stems from an unpaid medical bill, a forgotten utility balance, or a credit card that fell behind, a single collection can drag your score down by 50 to 110 points and stay on your report for seven years. But a collection does not have to define your financial future. Understanding how collections work, what your rights are, and which strategies actually move the needle can help you take control of the situation and start rebuilding.

This guide walks through how debts end up in collections, the real impact on your credit score, your rights when dealing with collectors, and proven strategies for recovering your creditworthiness.

## How Debts End Up in Collections

A debt does not go to collections overnight. There is a predictable timeline that plays out over several months before a collection agency ever gets involved.

### The Collection Timeline

1. **Missed payment (Day 1-30):** You miss a payment. The original creditor sends a late notice. At this point, you may owe a late fee, but the account has not been reported as delinquent yet. Most creditors report to the bureaus after 30 days past due.
2. **Continued delinquency (30-120 days):** If the account remains unpaid, the creditor continues sending notices and may call you directly. Your account is reported as 30, 60, and then 90 days past due to the credit bureaus, with each stage causing further damage to your score.
3. **Charge-off (typically 120-180 days):** After approximately 180 days of non-payment, the creditor writes off the debt as a loss — a "charge-off." This is an accounting action; it does not mean you no longer owe the money. The charge-off itself is reported to the credit bureaus as a severe negative mark.
4. **Debt sold or assigned to a collection agency:** The original creditor either sells the debt to a third-party collection agency (usually for pennies on the dollar) or hires an agency to collect on their behalf. The collection agency then reports the account to the credit bureaus as a new collection entry.
5. **Collection appears on your credit report:** You now have both the original charge-off and the new collection account on your report. This is when many consumers first realize the severity of the situation.

### Common Debts That Go to Collections

Almost any unpaid debt can eventually end up in collections, but some types are more common than others:

- **Medical bills** — The most common type of collection. Insurance processing delays and billing errors frequently cause medical debts to go to collections even when patients are not aware they owe a balance.
- **Credit card debt** — Unpaid credit card balances are routinely sold to collection agencies after charge-off.
- **Utility bills** — Electric, gas, water, and internet providers send unpaid balances to collections, often for relatively small amounts.
- **Cell phone bills** — Early termination fees and final account balances frequently end up with collectors.
- **Personal loans** — Defaulted [personal loans](/loans/bad-credit) follow the same charge-off-to-collection timeline as credit cards.
- **Rent** — Unpaid rent or lease-breaking penalties can be sent to collections and reported to the bureaus.

Understanding this timeline matters because it affects your options. If you catch a delinquency early — before it reaches collections — you may be able to negotiate with the original creditor and prevent the collection from ever appearing on your report. Once it has been reported, your strategy shifts to damage control and negotiation.

## The Credit Score Impact

A new collection account is one of the most damaging single events that can hit your credit report. How much it hurts depends on your starting score and the rest of your credit profile.

### How Many Points You Can Lose

| Starting Score Range | Approximate Score After New Collection | Estimated Point Drop |
|---|---|---|
| 780+ (Excellent) | 670 - 690 | 90 - 110 points |
| 720 - 779 (Very Good) | 640 - 680 | 60 - 100 points |
| 670 - 719 (Good) | 600 - 660 | 50 - 80 points |
| 580 - 669 (Fair) | 530 - 620 | 50 - 60 points |
| Below 580 (Poor) | 500 - 550 | 30 - 50 points |

People with higher credit scores experience the steepest drops. This is because scoring models weigh negative events more heavily when they are out of character with the rest of your profile. If you have a spotless record and a 780 score, a collection is a stark departure from the pattern — and the algorithm reacts accordingly. If your score is already low with existing negative marks, one more collection has a smaller marginal impact, though it still hurts.

### Diminishing Impact Over Time

The first collection on a clean report causes the most damage. If you already have one collection, a second one will still lower your score, but the drop will be smaller. The scoring models have already identified you as higher risk, so each additional negative mark has a diminishing effect. This does not mean additional collections are harmless — they are not — but the initial shock is the worst.

The impact of a collection also decreases as it ages. A collection that is five years old hurts your score far less than one that was reported last month. Scoring models give more weight to recent activity, so time is partially on your side even if you do nothing. That said, actively addressing the collection can accelerate your recovery.

## How Different Scoring Models Handle Collections

Not all credit scoring models treat collections the same way. This matters because different lenders use different models, and your strategy should depend on which model your target lender relies on.

| Scoring Model | Paid Collections | Unpaid Collections | Medical Collections | Key Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| FICO 8 | Counted (hurts score) | Counted (hurts score) | Ignores collections under $100 | Most widely used model by lenders |
| FICO 9 | Ignored (no impact) | Counted (hurts score) | Less weight on all medical collections | Growing adoption, especially for mortgages |
| FICO 10 / 10T | Ignored (no impact) | Counted (hurts score) | Less weight on medical collections | Newest FICO model, used by some lenders |
| VantageScore 3.0 | Ignored (no impact) | Counted (hurts score) | Less weight on medical collections | Used by Credit Karma and many free score services |
| VantageScore 4.0 | Ignored (no impact) | Counted (hurts score) | Most forgiving treatment of medical debt | Most lenient model for collections |

### Which Models Lenders Actually Use

Here is the reality: FICO 8 remains the most commonly used scoring model across the lending industry. Most credit card issuers, auto lenders, and personal loan providers use some version of FICO 8. Mortgage lenders have historically used even older FICO versions (FICO 2, 4, and 5) but are transitioning to FICO 10T and VantageScore 4.0 under updated guidelines from the Federal Housing Finance Agency.

This means that if you pay off a collection, your score may or may not improve depending on the model. Under FICO 8, paying a collection does not change the score calculation — the paid collection still counts against you. Under FICO 9, VantageScore 3.0, and VantageScore 4.0, paid collections are completely excluded from the score calculation.

The takeaway: before deciding whether to pay a collection specifically for score improvement, try to find out which scoring model your target lender uses.

## Should You Pay Off Old Collections?

This is one of the most common questions in personal finance, and the answer is not as straightforward as you might expect.

### When Paying Helps

- **You are applying for a mortgage.** Mortgage underwriters manually review your credit report regardless of your score. Most require all collections to be paid before closing. Even if paying does not change your automated score, it removes a red flag for manual review.
- **Your lender uses FICO 9 or VantageScore.** Under these models, paid collections are excluded from the calculation entirely. Paying can produce an immediate score improvement.
- **The collection agency agrees to a pay-for-delete.** If the agency will remove the entry from your report in exchange for payment, paying eliminates the damage entirely (more on this below).
- **You want peace of mind.** Unpaid collections can lead to lawsuits and wage garnishment in some states. Paying resolves the legal risk, even if the score impact is uncertain.
- **You are refinancing or applying for new credit.** Many lenders look at whether collections are paid or unpaid as part of their decision, separate from the automated score.

### When Paying May Not Help Your Score

- **Your lender uses FICO 8.** Under FICO 8, a paid collection and an unpaid collection are treated identically in the score calculation. Paying will not move the number.
- **The collection is near the 7-year expiration.** If a collection is 6+ years old and about to drop off your report, paying it may not be worth the cost — especially since paying resets the "date of last activity" on some reports, potentially keeping it visible longer (though it should not restart the 7-year clock).
- **You would deplete your emergency fund.** If paying a collection means you cannot cover basic expenses, the financial risk may outweigh the credit benefit.

### A Simple Decision Framework

Ask yourself these questions in order:

1. Is the debt valid? (If not, dispute it — see below.)
2. Is the statute of limitations for legal collection still active in your state? (If expired, the collector cannot sue you, reducing urgency.)
3. What scoring model does your target lender use? (FICO 9 or VantageScore = paying helps. FICO 8 = paying may not change score.)
4. Can you negotiate a pay-for-delete? (If yes, paying is almost always worth it.)
5. Do you have a major credit application coming up? (If yes, most lenders want collections resolved.)

## How to Deal with Collection Agencies

You have significant legal protections when dealing with debt collectors. The [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-debt-collection-practices-act) is the federal law that governs how collectors can and cannot treat you.

### Your Rights Under the FDCPA

- **Collectors cannot call you before 8:00 a.m. or after 9:00 p.m.** in your local time zone.
- **They must identify themselves** as debt collectors in every communication.
- **They must provide written verification** of the debt (amount, original creditor, and your rights) within five days of first contact.
- **They cannot threaten you with jail** or arrest. Failing to pay a debt is not a criminal offense.
- **They cannot use abusive or profane language.**
- **They cannot contact your employer** about the debt except to verify your employment information.
- **They must stop contacting you** if you send a written request asking them to cease communication. This does not erase the debt, but it stops the calls and letters.
- **You have the right to dispute the debt** within 30 days of receiving their initial notice. During the dispute, they must pause collection efforts until they provide verification.

If a collector violates any of these rules, you can file a complaint with the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB)](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/debt-collection/) and may be entitled to damages under the FDCPA.

### Request a Debt Validation Letter

This is your most important first step. Within 30 days of a collector's initial contact, send a written request asking them to validate the debt. They must provide proof that the debt is yours, the amount is correct, and they have the legal right to collect it. Many collections — especially older debts that have been sold multiple times — contain errors in the amount owed or are attributed to the wrong person. Do not pay anything until you have validation in writing.

## Negotiation Strategies

Once you have confirmed a collection is valid, you have more leverage than you might think. Collection agencies typically purchase debts for 4 to 20 cents on the dollar. Any payment they receive above their purchase price is profit. This creates room to negotiate.

### Step-by-Step Negotiation Process

**1. Verify the debt is actually yours.** Request validation as described above. If the collector cannot verify the debt, they are legally required to remove it from your credit report.

**2. Check the statute of limitations.** Every state has a statute of limitations on debt collection — the window during which a creditor can sue you to collect. Once it expires, the collector loses legal enforcement power. If the statute has passed, you may choose not to pay at all (though the collection can remain on your report until the 7-year mark).

**3. Negotiate a settlement.** Offering a lump-sum payment of 30% to 50% of the original balance is common and frequently accepted. Start with a lower offer (20-25%) and negotiate from there. Collectors would rather get something than nothing, especially on older debts.

**4. Try a pay-for-delete agreement.** Ask the collector to remove the collection entry from your credit report in exchange for your payment (see the next section for details).

**5. Get everything in writing.** Never make a payment based on a verbal agreement. Request a written settlement agreement that specifies the amount you will pay, that the payment satisfies the debt in full, and any terms regarding credit reporting (such as a pay-for-delete). Keep copies of everything.

**6. Never provide direct bank account access.** Do not give a collector your bank account or routing number over the phone. Pay by cashier's check, money order, or through a secure online portal where you control the transaction.

## Pay-for-Delete: Does It Work?

A pay-for-delete is an arrangement where the collection agency agrees to remove the collection entry from your credit report in exchange for your payment. If successful, it is the best possible outcome — the negative mark disappears entirely as if it never existed.

### How It Works

Pay-for-delete agreements are not officially endorsed by the credit bureaus. The bureaus' policies technically require data furnishers (collection agencies) to report accurate information. Removing a legitimate collection after payment could be seen as reporting inaccurate data. However, in practice, many collection agencies — particularly smaller ones — will agree to pay-for-delete arrangements because they want to get paid and have no strong incentive to maintain the reporting.

### How to Request a Pay-for-Delete

1. Contact the collection agency in writing (not by phone).
2. State that you are willing to pay the debt (or a negotiated amount) in full.
3. Condition your payment on the agency removing the collection entry from all three credit bureau reports.
4. Request a signed written agreement before making any payment.
5. After paying, follow up in 30-60 days to confirm the entry has been removed from your Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion reports.

### What If They Refuse?

Not all agencies will agree. Larger agencies and creditors are less likely to offer pay-for-delete. If refused, you still have other options: negotiate the amount owed, request a "paid in full" status update (which helps under FICO 9 and VantageScore), or simply wait for the collection to age off your report. You can also try escalating your request to a supervisor or writing directly to the original creditor.

## Medical Collections: Special Rules

Medical debt is the most common type of collection in America, and recent changes have made it less damaging than other types of collection debt.

### How Medical Collections Are Treated Differently

- **FICO 9 and newer models** assign less weight to medical collections than non-medical ones, and they ignore paid medical collections entirely.
- **FICO 8** ignores medical collections under $100 but otherwise treats them the same as other collections.
- **The three major credit bureaus** implemented significant changes: paid medical collections are removed from credit reports, medical collections are not reported until they are at least 12 months old (giving you time to resolve insurance disputes), and medical collections under $500 are no longer reported.

### Why Medical Bills End Up in Collections Unfairly

Medical billing is notoriously complex. Insurance claims can take months to process. Bills get sent to the wrong address. Patients receive bills for amounts that should have been covered by insurance. By the time a medical bill reaches collections, many patients did not even know they owed anything.

If you receive notice of a medical collection, your first step should be to contact your insurance company and the medical provider to verify that the bill was processed correctly. Many medical collections can be resolved by simply getting the insurance company to reprocess a claim.

## Rebuilding Credit After Collections

A collection on your credit report is a setback, but it is not permanent. With the right approach, you can rebuild your credit and eventually qualify for competitive loan terms again.

### Strategies That Work

**Open a secured credit card.** A [secured credit card](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score) requires a refundable deposit that typically serves as your credit limit. Use it for small purchases, keep utilization below 10%, and pay the balance in full every month. After 6 to 12 months of responsible use, many issuers upgrade you to an unsecured card.

**Get a credit-builder loan.** A [credit-builder loan](/guides/credit-builder-loans) holds your loan funds in a locked savings account while you make payments. Each on-time payment is reported to the bureaus, building positive payment history. This is one of the most effective tools for people recovering from collections.

**Become an authorized user.** If a trusted family member has a credit card with a long history of on-time payments and low utilization, being added as an authorized user can immediately add positive history to your credit profile.

**Keep all other accounts current.** The single most important thing you can do is avoid any new negative marks. Pay every bill on time, keep credit card balances low, and do not take on debt you cannot manage. One collection is recoverable. A pattern of missed payments and collections makes recovery significantly harder.

**Monitor your credit regularly.** Check your credit reports through [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/) and your score through free services. Watching your score improve after implementing these strategies is motivating and helps you catch any new issues early. See our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free) for all your options.

### Timeline for Recovery

With consistent effort, here is what a realistic rebuilding timeline looks like:

| Timeframe | What to Expect |
|---|---|
| 3 Months | New positive accounts begin appearing on your report. Secured card and credit-builder loan payments building history. |
| 6 Months | Noticeable score improvement (20-50 points) if all new accounts are in good standing. |
| 12 Months | Significant recovery possible (50-100+ points). Collection impact is diminishing with age. |
| 2-3 Years | Many borrowers reach "fair" to "good" credit range if they maintain positive habits. |
| 7 Years | Collection falls off credit report entirely. |

## When to Seek Professional Help

While you can handle most collection situations on your own, certain scenarios warrant professional guidance:

- **You are being sued by a collector.** Consult a consumer law attorney, especially one familiar with the FDCPA.
- **You have multiple large debts in collections.** A nonprofit credit counselor from the [National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC)](https://www.nfcc.org/) can help you create a debt management plan at little or no cost.
- **You suspect identity theft.** If collections are appearing for debts you never incurred, file a report with the FTC and consider a credit freeze.

Avoid for-profit credit repair companies that charge large upfront fees. They cannot do anything you cannot do yourself, and many use deceptive practices. The [CFPB](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/debt-collection/) and NFCC are free, legitimate resources.

## Need Help Finding a Loan?

If you are dealing with collections and need access to funding, you still have options. Many lenders work with borrowers who have [imperfect credit histories](/loans/bad-credit), and comparing offers from multiple lenders ensures you find the best available terms for your situation.

Collections are stressful, but they are manageable. Verify what you owe, know your rights, negotiate strategically, and focus on building positive credit habits going forward. Every on-time payment and every responsible credit decision moves you further from the collection and closer to the financial future you want.
