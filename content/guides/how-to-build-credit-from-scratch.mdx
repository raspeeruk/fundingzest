faqs:
  - question: "How long does it take to build credit from nothing?"
    answer: "You can establish a credit score within 3-6 months of opening your first credit account. Building a 'Good' score (670+) typically takes 12-24 months of responsible credit use. The key factors are making on-time payments and keeping credit utilization low."
  - question: "Is no credit the same as bad credit?"
    answer: "No. No credit (also called a 'thin file') means you don't have enough credit history for scoring models to generate a score. Bad credit means you have a history with negative marks. Having no credit is generally easier to overcome than having bad credit, since you're starting with a clean slate."
  - question: "What's the easiest way to start building credit?"
    answer: "The easiest option for most people is becoming an authorized user on a family member's credit card with good history. This requires no application and gives you credit history immediately. The next easiest is a secured credit card, which has minimal approval requirements since you provide a cash deposit as collateral."
  - question: "Can I build credit without a credit card?"
    answer: "Yes. Credit-builder loans, rent reporting services (like Experian Boost), and becoming an authorized user all build credit without requiring a credit card. However, a secured credit card remains one of the most effective tools because it builds both credit history and demonstrates responsible revolving credit use."
  - question: "Does paying rent build credit?"
    answer: "Not automatically. Traditional rent payments are not reported to credit bureaus unless you or your landlord use a rent reporting service. Experian Boost and services like Rental Kharma or LevelCredit can report your rent payments to help build your credit profile."

Building credit is one of those things nobody teaches you in school, yet it affects nearly every major financial decision you will make as an adult. Your credit score determines the interest rate on your car loan, whether you get approved for an apartment, how much you pay for insurance, and in some cases, whether you land a job. The problem is that you need credit to get credit — a frustrating catch-22 that leaves millions of Americans stuck at square one.

The good news: building credit from nothing is not only possible, it is straightforward if you follow the right steps. This guide walks you through seven proven strategies to establish a credit history from scratch, the timeline you can realistically expect, and the mistakes to avoid along the way.

## Why Credit Matters

Your credit score is a three-digit number between 300 and 850 that tells lenders how risky it is to lend you money. A higher score means lower risk, which translates directly into better financial terms across your entire life.

Here is what your credit score affects:

- **Loan interest rates.** The difference between a 670 and a 750 credit score on a $10,000 personal loan can mean paying $1,200 less in interest over three years. On a mortgage, the savings can exceed $50,000 over the life of the loan.
- **Apartment approvals.** Most landlords check credit before approving a lease. A thin file or no score can result in denial, a required co-signer, or a larger security deposit.
- **Insurance premiums.** In most states, auto and homeowners insurance companies use credit-based insurance scores to set your rates. Lower credit means higher premiums.
- **Employment screening.** Some employers — particularly in finance, government, and positions involving access to money — review credit reports as part of the hiring process.
- **Utility deposits.** Without an established credit history, utility companies may require deposits of $100 to $300 before activating service.

The catch-22 is real: you need a credit history to access affordable credit, but you cannot build a history without getting credit in the first place. The strategies below are specifically designed to break that cycle.

## No Credit vs Bad Credit

Before diving into solutions, it is important to understand where you stand. Having no credit is fundamentally different from having bad credit, and the distinction matters for your strategy.

**No credit (thin file)** means the credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion — do not have enough information about you to generate a credit score. The FICO scoring model requires at least one account that has been open for six months and at least one account reported to the bureaus within the last six months. If you do not meet those thresholds, you are "unscorable." This is common for young adults, recent immigrants, and people who have always operated in cash.

**Bad credit** means you have a credit history, but it includes negative marks — late payments, collections, charge-offs, or bankruptcy — that have driven your score below 580. The bureaus know who you are; they just have unfavorable information.

The key difference: **no credit is a blank page, while bad credit is a page with mistakes on it.** Starting from a blank page is generally easier. You are not fighting against negative history; you simply need to create positive history. Most of the strategies in this guide work for both situations, but if you have existing bad credit, you may also want to read our guide on [how to improve your credit score](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score).

## 7 Proven Ways to Build Credit from Zero

These strategies are ordered roughly from easiest to most involved. You do not need to do all seven — even one or two, used consistently, will establish your credit within months. Combining two or three accelerates the process significantly because it builds multiple trade lines and diversifies your credit mix.

### 1. Become an Authorized User

The fastest way to get a credit history on your report is to be added as an authorized user on someone else's credit card. When a family member or trusted person adds you to their account, the card issuer reports that account's entire history to your credit file. If the primary cardholder has a card with five years of on-time payments and low utilization, that history now appears on your report as well.

**How to do it:**
- Ask a parent, spouse, or close family member with a long-standing credit card account and excellent payment history.
- The primary cardholder calls their card issuer and requests to add you. They will need your name, date of birth, and Social Security number.
- You do not need to use the card. In fact, the primary cardholder does not even need to give you the physical card. The credit-building benefit comes from the account appearing on your report.

**What to look for in the primary account:**
- A long history (the older the account, the better)
- Perfect or near-perfect on-time payment record
- Low credit utilization (under 30%, ideally under 10%)
- An issuer that reports authorized users to all three bureaus (most major issuers do, but verify)

<Callout type="warning" title="Authorized User Risk">
If the primary cardholder misses payments or carries high balances, that negative activity will hurt **your** score too. Only piggyback on accounts with strong, consistent history.

### 2. Get a Secured Credit Card

A secured credit card is the single most popular tool for building credit from scratch, and for good reason. You provide a refundable cash deposit — typically $200 to $500 — which becomes your credit limit. You then use the card like any regular credit card, and the issuer reports your activity to the credit bureaus each month.

Because the deposit eliminates the lender's risk, secured cards have minimal approval requirements. Most do not require a credit score at all.

**How to use it effectively:**
- Use the card for one or two small, recurring purchases each month — a streaming subscription or a tank of gas.
- Pay the balance in full every month before the due date. This keeps your utilization near zero and avoids interest charges.
- Set up autopay for the full balance so you never miss a payment.

**Recommended options:**
- **Discover it Secured** — Reports to all three bureaus, no annual fee, earns cash back, and automatically reviews your account for upgrade to an unsecured card after 7 months.
- **Capital One Platinum Secured** — Deposits as low as $49 for some applicants, reports to all three bureaus, and offers automatic upgrade reviews.

Most secured cardholders graduate to an unsecured card within 12 months, at which point the deposit is returned. The key is consistency: small charges, full payments, every month without exception.

### 3. Apply for a Credit-Builder Loan

A credit-builder loan flips the traditional lending model. Instead of receiving money upfront, the loan amount is held in a locked savings account while you make monthly payments. Each payment is reported to the credit bureaus. Once you complete the loan, the savings are released to you.

The result is that you build a positive payment history **and** end up with a lump sum of savings — typically $300 to $1,000.

Credit-builder loans are offered by credit unions, community banks, and online lenders like Self. APRs are usually between 5% and 16%, making them among the most affordable credit products available. A $500 credit-builder loan at 10% APR over 12 months costs approximately $26 in total interest — roughly the price of a takeout dinner.

For a complete breakdown of how these loans work, costs, and where to get one, read our full guide on [credit-builder loans](/guides/credit-builder-loans).

### 4. Use Experian Boost

Experian Boost is a free service from Experian that lets you add utility bills, phone bills, and streaming service payments to your Experian credit report. These are bills you are already paying — Experian Boost simply ensures you get credit for them.

**How it works:**
- Sign up for a free Experian account.
- Connect your bank account so Experian can identify qualifying payments.
- Choose which payment histories to add (utilities, phone, streaming services like Netflix or Hulu).
- Your Experian report is updated immediately.

According to Experian, the average user sees a score increase of approximately 13 points. Some users see larger gains, particularly those with thin files.

**Limitations:** Experian Boost only affects your Experian credit report and scores based on Experian data. It does not impact your Equifax or TransUnion reports. If a lender pulls your credit from a different bureau, the boosted payments will not be reflected. Still, as a free and immediate tool, it is worth using as part of a broader strategy.

### 5. Use a Rent Reporting Service

If you pay rent, you are making one of your largest monthly payments — but unless your landlord reports it, that payment does absolutely nothing for your credit. Rent reporting services bridge this gap by sending your rent payment history to the credit bureaus.

**Popular services include:**
- **Rental Kharma** — Reports to TransUnion, can include up to 24 months of past rent payments.
- **LevelCredit (now Experian RentBureau)** — Reports to all three bureaus.
- **Boom** — Reports to all three bureaus, starting at $2 per month.

Most services cost between $5 and $10 per month. Some can report retroactive payments, adding months or even years of positive payment history to your report in one update.

Rent reporting is especially valuable for people who have been paying rent reliably for years but have no other credit history. Adding that track record to your credit file can provide an immediate foundation.

### 6. Get a Student Credit Card

If you are a college student, student credit cards are designed specifically for your situation. These cards do not require an existing credit history, and approval criteria focus on enrollment status and income (including part-time jobs, scholarships, or allowances) rather than credit scores.

**Typical features:**
- Credit limits of $500 to $1,000
- No annual fee
- Basic rewards (cash back on purchases)
- Reports to all three credit bureaus
- Educational tools for managing credit

The same rules apply as with any credit card: use it for small purchases, pay the balance in full each month, and never treat the credit limit as free money. A student credit card used responsibly for two to three years of college gives you a solid credit foundation by the time you graduate.

If you are under 21, federal law (the CARD Act) requires you to have either proof of independent income or a co-signer to open a credit card on your own. A part-time job or consistent freelance income generally qualifies.

### 7. Take Out a Small Installment Loan

Adding an installment loan — a loan with fixed monthly payments over a set term — to your credit profile diversifies your credit mix, which accounts for 10% of your FICO score. Even a small loan of $500 repaid over 6 months adds both payment history and credit variety.

Options include personal [installment loans](/loans/installment) from online lenders, many of which work with borrowers who have thin files or no credit history. The APR will be higher than what someone with established credit would pay, but if you borrow a small amount and repay it quickly, the total interest cost is manageable and the credit-building benefit is real.

Before taking on any loan, make sure you can comfortably afford the payments. Use our [loan calculator](/calculator) to estimate your monthly payment before you commit.

## Credit-Building Timeline

Building credit is a gradual process, but progress comes faster than most people expect. Here is a realistic timeline for someone starting from zero:

| Timeframe | What Happens | Score Expectations |
|---|---|---|
| Month 1-3 | Open your first credit account (secured card, credit-builder loan, or authorized user). Make on-time payments. A score may appear by month 3 if using FICO; VantageScore can generate after just 1 month. | Score may appear: 580-650 range typical for new files |
| Month 3-6 | Continue making on-time payments. Keep utilization low. Your score begins to reflect consistent positive behavior. | 620-670 range with responsible use |
| Month 6-12 | Score improves as payment history grows. Consider adding a second account to diversify credit mix (e.g., add a credit-builder loan if you started with a secured card). | 650-700 range |
| Month 12-24 | Sustained on-time payments push you into the "Good" range. Your secured card may graduate to unsecured. Credit-builder loan pays out savings. | 670-720+ range (Good to Very Good) |

These ranges assume consistent on-time payments and low utilization. Missing a payment or maxing out a card can set your progress back significantly.

## Rules for Building Credit Successfully

Regardless of which strategies you choose, these fundamental rules apply to everyone building credit:

<StatHighlight value="60-100 pts" label="potential score drop from a single missed payment — it stays on your report for 7 years" icon="trending-down" variant="red" />

**Pay on time, every time.** Payment history is 35% of your FICO score — the single largest factor. Even one payment that is 30 days late can drop your score by 60 to 100 points and stays on your report for seven years. Set up autopay on every account, at minimum for the minimum payment due. There is no reason to ever miss a payment in the age of automatic billing.

**Keep credit utilization under 30% — and under 10% if possible.** Credit utilization is the ratio of your credit card balance to your credit limit. If your secured card has a $500 limit, keep your balance below $150 (30%) and ideally below $50 (10%). Utilization is 30% of your score and updates every billing cycle, so this is one of the fastest levers you can pull.

**Do not apply for too many accounts at once.** Each credit application triggers a [hard inquiry](/guides/soft-vs-hard-credit-inquiries) on your report, which can temporarily lower your score by 3 to 5 points. More importantly, multiple applications in a short period signal desperation to lenders. Start with one or two accounts, use them well, and add more over time.

**Keep your accounts open.** The length of your credit history makes up 15% of your score. Closing your first credit card — even if you no longer use it — shortens your history and reduces your available credit (which increases utilization). Keep old accounts open and active with occasional small purchases.

**Monitor your progress monthly.** Check your credit score for free through your bank, Credit Karma, or Experian. Review your full credit reports regularly at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/) to catch errors or fraud early. Watching your score climb is motivating and keeps you accountable. For a full walkthrough, see our guide on [how to check your credit score for free](/guides/how-to-check-credit-score-free).

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

Building credit is simple in theory but easy to derail with avoidable mistakes. Here are the most common pitfalls for first-time credit users:

**Closing your first credit card.** Your oldest account anchors your credit history length. Even if you get a better card later, keep your first card open. Set a small recurring charge on it and autopay the balance to keep it active.

**Maxing out your secured card.** A secured card with a $300 limit and a $295 balance has 98% utilization — devastating to your score. Treat your credit limit as a boundary you never approach, not a spending target.

**Applying for too many cards at once.** Getting denied for an unsecured card and immediately applying for three more creates a cascade of hard inquiries with no new accounts to show for it. Be strategic. Start with products designed for no-credit borrowers (secured cards, credit-builder loans), and move up as your score grows.

**Not monitoring your credit.** Errors happen. Fraud happens. An incorrect late payment on your report can silently damage your score for months before you notice. Check your reports at least quarterly through [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). The [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/) provides free tools and dispute templates to help you correct any inaccuracies.
