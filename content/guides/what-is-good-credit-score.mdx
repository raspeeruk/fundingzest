  - question: "What credit score do I need to get a loan?"
    answer: "It depends on the loan type. Traditional bank personal loans typically require 670+. Online installment lenders may accept 580+. Payday lenders and some bad-credit lenders have no minimum score requirement. Higher scores qualify for lower APRs and better terms."
  - question: "What is the average credit score in America?"
    answer: "The average FICO score in the United States is approximately 715 as of 2025, which falls in the 'Good' range (670-739). However, scores vary significantly by age group, state, and economic conditions. About 21% of Americans have scores below 600."
  - question: "Is 700 a good credit score?"
    answer: "Yes, 700 is considered a 'Good' credit score on both the FICO (670-739 = Good) and VantageScore (661-780 = Good) scales. With a 700 score, you should qualify for most personal loans, credit cards, and auto loans at competitive rates, though not the absolute best rates available."
  - question: "What's the difference between FICO and VantageScore?"
    answer: "Both are credit scoring models that range from 300-850, but they weigh factors differently. FICO is used by 90% of top lenders for lending decisions. VantageScore is commonly shown by free services like Credit Karma. Your scores may differ by 20-40 points between models, which is normal."
  - question: "Can I get a mortgage with a 620 credit score?"
    answer: "Yes, but options are limited. FHA loans accept scores as low as 580 (with 3.5% down) or even 500 (with 10% down). Conventional mortgages typically require 620+. With a 620 score, expect higher interest rates than someone with a 740+ score, which can add tens of thousands to your total mortgage cost."

Your credit score is a three-digit number that lenders use to judge how risky it is to lend you money. It influences whether you get approved for a loan, what interest rate you pay, and how much that loan ultimately costs you. A difference of just 50 points can mean thousands of dollars saved or lost over the life of a loan.

But what actually counts as a "good" credit score? The answer depends on which scoring model you look at, what type of credit you are applying for, and what terms you want to qualify for. This guide breaks down exactly where the ranges fall, how the two major scoring models compare, and what your score means for your wallet.

## Credit Score Ranges Explained

Credit scores in the United States range from 300 to 850. The higher your score, the more creditworthy lenders consider you. Here is how the FICO scoring model, which is the most widely used by lenders, categorizes scores:

| FICO Range | Rating | % of Americans | Typical Loan Terms | What You Can Qualify For |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 800 - 850 | Exceptional | ~21% | Lowest APRs available (6-10% personal loans) | Best credit cards, lowest mortgage rates, premium rewards cards, any loan product at top-tier terms |
| 740 - 799 | Very Good | ~25% | Below-average APRs (9-14% personal loans) | Most premium credit cards, competitive mortgage rates, excellent auto loan terms, high-limit personal loans |
| 670 - 739 | Good | ~21% | Average APRs (13-20% personal loans) | Most personal loans, standard credit cards, conventional mortgages, auto loans at reasonable rates |
| 580 - 669 | Fair | ~17% | Above-average APRs (20-28% personal loans) | Some personal loans from online lenders, FHA mortgages, subprime auto loans, secured credit cards |
| 300 - 579 | Poor | ~16% | Highest APRs or denial (28-36%+ personal loans) | Bad-credit personal loans, payday alternatives, secured credit cards, credit-builder loans |

The "Good" range of 670 to 739 is where most Americans land. If your score falls here, you have access to the majority of mainstream financial products, though you will not receive the absolute best rates.

It is worth noting that roughly one in three Americans has a score below 670, which means they face higher borrowing costs or limited access to credit. If that describes your situation, you have options, and improving your score is entirely achievable with the right strategy.

## FICO vs VantageScore

There are two major credit scoring models in the United States: FICO and VantageScore. Both use a 300-850 scale, but they label the ranges differently and weigh your credit data with slightly different formulas.

| Feature | FICO Score | VantageScore |
|---|---|---|
| Score Range | 300 - 850 | 300 - 850 |
| "Good" Range | 670 - 739 | 661 - 780 |
| "Excellent" Range | 800 - 850 | 781 - 850 |
| "Fair" Range | 580 - 669 | 601 - 660 |
| "Poor" Range | 300 - 579 | 300 - 600 |
| Used by Lenders | ~90% of top lenders | Growing adoption, but still secondary |
| Where You See It | Bank statements, myFICO.com | Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, many bank apps |
| Minimum History Needed | 6 months of activity | 1 month of activity |

**Which one matters more?** For lending decisions, FICO dominates. Approximately 90% of top lenders use some version of the FICO score when deciding whether to approve you and what rate to offer. When a mortgage lender pulls your credit, they are almost certainly looking at a FICO score.

However, VantageScore is what most free credit monitoring services display. If you check your score on Credit Karma, Credit Sesame, or many banking apps, you are likely seeing your VantageScore. This is not a problem, but be aware that your FICO score may differ by 20 to 40 points in either direction. A 710 VantageScore does not guarantee a 710 FICO score.

**The bottom line:** Track your VantageScore for trends and general awareness. But when it matters most, such as before applying for a mortgage or auto loan, consider checking your actual FICO score through [myFICO.com](https://www.myfico.com/credit-education/credit-scores) or a bank that provides FICO scores to its customers.

## What Counts as "Good" Credit?

On the FICO scale, a "Good" credit score starts at 670. On VantageScore, the threshold is slightly lower at 661. For practical purposes, a score of 670 or above opens the door to most mainstream financial products.

With a good credit score, you can typically expect:

- **Personal loan approval** from most online and traditional lenders at competitive rates. Expect APRs in the 13-20% range for [installment loans](/loans/installment), compared to 25%+ for borrowers with fair credit.
- **Credit card access** including mid-tier rewards cards, balance transfer cards, and cards with reasonable credit limits.
- **Auto loan rates** significantly better than subprime. The difference between a 670 and a 580 score on a 60-month auto loan can be 5-8 percentage points in APR.
- **Mortgage eligibility** for conventional loans. While FHA loans accept lower scores, most conventional mortgages require at least 620, and a 670+ score helps you secure a better rate.

However, "good enough" depends entirely on what you are applying for. A 680 score is excellent for qualifying for a personal loan from an online lender, but it will not get you the best available mortgage rate, which typically requires 740 or above. Before applying for any major loan, research the specific score thresholds for the product you want.

## How Your Credit Score Affects Loan Costs

This is where your credit score stops being an abstract number and starts hitting your bank account. The table below shows what a $10,000 personal loan over 36 months looks like at different credit tiers:

| Credit Tier | Typical APR | Monthly Payment | Total Interest Paid | Total Cost |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Exceptional (800+) | 8% | $313 | $1,268 | $11,268 |
| Good (670-739) | 15% | $346 | $2,468 | $12,468 |
| Fair (580-669) | 25% | $397 | $4,282 | $14,282 |
| Poor (below 580) | 36% | $445 | $5,856 | $15,856 |

<StatHighlight value="$4,588" label="Extra interest paid by a poor-credit borrower vs exceptional credit on the same $10,000 loan — nearly half the loan amount lost to interest" icon="dollar" variant="red" />

This cost difference compounds with larger loans and longer terms. On a $250,000 mortgage over 30 years, the spread between an excellent and a fair credit score can exceed $100,000 in additional interest. Your credit score is not just a number. It is a price tag on every dollar you borrow.

## What Factors Determine Your Score

Your FICO score is calculated from five categories of information in your credit report. Each carries a different weight:

| Factor | Weight | What It Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Payment History | 35% | Whether you pay your bills on time. Late payments, collections, and bankruptcies all damage this factor. Even one 30-day late payment can drop your score by 60-100 points. |
| Credit Utilization | 30% | How much of your available credit you are using. Using $3,000 of a $10,000 credit limit means 30% utilization. Experts recommend keeping this below 30%, and below 10% for the best scores. |
| Length of Credit History | 15% | The average age of your accounts and the age of your oldest account. Longer history signals stability. This is why closing old credit cards can hurt your score. |
| Credit Mix | 10% | Having a variety of account types, including credit cards, installment loans, a mortgage, and retail accounts. A diverse mix shows you can manage different types of credit responsibly. |
| New Credit Inquiries | 10% | How many new accounts you have opened recently and how many hard inquiries appear on your report. Multiple applications in a short period can signal financial distress to lenders. |

<Callout type="tip" title="Focus on What Matters Most">
Payment history and credit utilization together account for **65% of your FICO score**. If you focus on just two things, make them paying every bill on time and keeping your credit card balances low relative to their limits.

## Credit Score by Age

Credit scores tend to rise with age. This is not because older people are inherently more responsible, but because they have had more time to build credit history, which is one of the five scoring factors.

| Age Group | Average FICO Score |
|---|---|
| 18 - 29 | ~680 |
| 30 - 39 | ~690 |
| 40 - 49 | ~700 |
| 50 - 59 | ~725 |
| 60+ | ~750 |

If you are in your 20s or 30s with a score below 700, you are not behind. You are roughly average for your age group. The most important thing is building good habits now, because those habits compound over time. A 25-year-old who starts paying everything on time and keeping utilization low is setting themselves up for an excellent score by their 40s.

Younger borrowers who need a loan today should not be discouraged by a score in the mid-600s. Many online lenders and [installment loan providers](/loans/installment) work with borrowers across the credit spectrum, and your age-adjusted score may be better than you think relative to your peers.

## How to Check Your Score for Free

You are entitled to check your credit reports for free, and several services let you monitor your score at no cost. Here are the best ways to check:

- **AnnualCreditReport.com** — The only federally authorized source for free credit reports from all three bureaus (Equifax, Experian, TransUnion). You can access your reports weekly at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com/). These reports show your full credit history but do not include your score.
- **Your bank or credit card issuer** — Most major banks and credit card companies now provide free FICO or VantageScore access to their customers through online banking or their mobile app.
- **Credit Karma and Credit Sesame** — Free services that show your VantageScore and provide credit monitoring. Keep in mind these show VantageScore, not FICO.
- **The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau** — The [CFPB offers free resources](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/credit-reports-and-scores/) to help you understand your credit reports and dispute errors.

<Callout type="info" title="Checking Your Score Won't Hurt It">
Checking your own credit score is a "soft inquiry" and does **not** affect your score. You can check as often as you like without penalty.

## How to Improve Your Score

If your score is not where you want it to be, the good news is that credit scores are not permanent. Most people can see meaningful improvement within 3 to 6 months by taking the right steps.

Here are the highest-impact actions you can take:

- **Pay every bill on time.** Set up autopay for at least the minimum payment on every account. Payment history is 35% of your score, and even one missed payment can cause significant damage.
- **Reduce your credit utilization.** Pay down credit card balances to get your utilization below 30%. If possible, aim for below 10%. This is 30% of your score and one of the fastest factors to improve.
<StatHighlight value="1 in 5" label="Credit reports contain an error according to FTC research — check yours for free" icon="warning" variant="red" />

- **Check your credit report for errors.** Approximately 1 in 5 credit reports contains an error, according to FTC research. Dispute inaccuracies with the credit bureaus, especially incorrect late payments, wrong balances, or accounts that do not belong to you.
- **Keep old accounts open.** Even if you no longer use a credit card, keeping it open preserves your credit history length and available credit limit, both of which help your score.
- **Limit new applications.** Each hard inquiry can temporarily lower your score by a few points. Space out credit applications and only apply when you genuinely need new credit.

## What If You Have Bad Credit?

A low credit score feels limiting, but it does not mean you are locked out of borrowing. Millions of Americans with scores below 580 access credit every year, and there are financial products specifically designed for this situation.

**Options if your score is below 580:**

- **Bad-credit personal loans** — Several online lenders specialize in working with borrowers who have poor credit. Interest rates will be higher (typically 25-36%), but these loans can help you cover an emergency expense or consolidate high-interest debt. See our [bad-credit loan options](/loans/bad-credit) for current lender comparisons.
- **Credit-builder loans** — These small loans are designed specifically to help you build credit. Instead of receiving funds upfront, your payments are held in a savings account and reported to the credit bureaus. After the loan term, you receive the funds plus any interest earned. Learn more in our guide to [credit-builder loans](/guides/credit-builder-loans).
- **Secured credit cards** — You put down a deposit (usually $200-$500) that becomes your credit limit. Use the card for small purchases, pay the balance in full each month, and your on-time payments get reported to the bureaus, gradually raising your score.
- **Become an authorized user** — If a family member with good credit adds you as an authorized user on their credit card, their positive payment history on that account can boost your score. You do not even need to use the card.

The most important thing to understand about bad credit is that it is temporary. Negative items like late payments age off your report after seven years, and bankruptcies after seven to ten years. With consistent positive behavior, you can move from "Poor" to "Fair" in as little as 6 to 12 months, and from "Fair" to "Good" within one to two years.

Do not let a low score paralyze you. Take action today, even if it is just pulling your free credit report and reviewing it for errors.
