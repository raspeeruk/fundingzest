  - question: "What inputs do I need for a loan calculator?"
    answer: "You need three inputs: the loan amount (how much you want to borrow), the APR (annual percentage rate, which includes interest and certain fees), and the loan term (how many months you'll take to repay). With these three numbers, the calculator determines your monthly payment, total cost, and total interest paid."
  - question: "Is the calculator amount exact?"
    answer: "Calculator results are estimates based on the information you enter. Actual loan terms may differ based on the lender's specific fees, your credit profile, state regulations, and other factors. Use calculator results to compare scenarios, not as guaranteed loan terms."
  - question: "Why does a longer term mean more total interest?"
    answer: "With a longer term, you make more monthly payments, and interest accrues for a longer period. A $3,000 loan at 24% APR costs $407 in interest over 12 months but $859 in interest over 24 months. The monthly payment is lower ($282 vs $158), but you pay more than twice the interest."
  - question: "How can I use the calculator to save money?"
    answer: "Compare scenarios: try different APRs (shop for the lowest), different terms (shorter = less total interest), and different amounts (borrow only what you need). The biggest savings usually come from getting a lower APR through better credit or choosing a different lender."

## What Is a Loan Calculator?

A loan calculator is a tool that takes three numbers — the amount you want to borrow, the annual percentage rate (APR), and the repayment term — and shows you exactly what that loan will cost. Specifically, it tells you your **monthly payment**, your **total cost** (principal plus all interest), and how much of what you pay is **pure interest** (the cost of borrowing).

Every borrower should use a loan calculator before accepting any loan offer. The reason is simple: the same loan amount can cost dramatically different amounts depending on the APR and term. A $2,000 loan might cost you $160 in interest or $1,600 in interest depending on the terms. Without running the numbers, you are guessing — and guessing with borrowed money is expensive.

Loan calculators are free, take less than 30 seconds to use, and can save you hundreds of dollars by showing you exactly what you are agreeing to pay. They are especially valuable for comparing multiple offers, testing different term lengths, and understanding how much a lower APR actually saves you in real dollars.

## The Three Inputs You Need

A standard loan calculator requires three pieces of information. You can find all three on any legitimate loan offer letter or lender website.

### Loan Amount

This is the amount of money you want to borrow — the principal. If a lender charges an origination fee that is deducted from your disbursement, the loan amount is the full amount before the fee is deducted, not the cash you receive. For example, if you borrow $5,000 and the lender deducts a 3% origination fee ($150), the loan amount is $5,000 — because you owe interest on the full $5,000.

### APR (Annual Percentage Rate)

The APR is the annualized cost of the loan expressed as a percentage. It includes the interest rate plus certain mandatory fees (like origination fees), which makes it more comprehensive than the interest rate alone. Federal law requires lenders to disclose the APR before you sign.

Where to find it: your loan offer, the lender's website, or by asking the lender directly. If a lender will not disclose the APR, that is a red flag. For more on how APR works and what it includes, see our guide on [understanding APR on small-dollar loans](/guides/understanding-apr-small-dollar-loans).

### Loan Term

The term is how long you have to repay the loan, usually expressed in months. Common terms for personal loans range from 3 months to 60 months. The term you choose affects both your monthly payment and your total cost — shorter terms mean higher monthly payments but less total interest.

Some states cap the maximum term for certain loan types. Check your state's regulations if you are unsure what terms are available to you.

## The Three Outputs You Get

Once you enter your three inputs, the calculator returns three key numbers.

### Monthly Payment

This is the amount you will pay each month for the duration of the loan. For a fixed-rate loan (which most personal loans are), this number stays the same every month from the first payment to the last.

### Total Cost

This is the total amount of money you will pay over the life of the loan — principal plus all interest. It equals your monthly payment multiplied by the number of months.

### Total Interest

This is how much the loan costs you in interest alone — the price of borrowing. It equals the total cost minus the original loan amount. This number tells you the true cost of the loan beyond the money you actually received.

**Example:** A $2,000 loan at 36% APR for 12 months produces:

- **Monthly payment:** $180
- **Total cost:** $2,160
- **Total interest:** $160

That means borrowing $2,000 for one year at 36% APR costs you $160. Whether that is a good deal depends on what other options are available to you — and a loan calculator helps you figure that out by running multiple scenarios.

## How to Use FundingZest's Loan Calculator

Our [loan calculator](/calculator) is designed to make comparison easy. Here is how to use it:

1. **Enter the loan amount.** Type in the dollar amount you want to borrow. Start with the amount you actually need — not the maximum a lender offers you.
2. **Enter the APR.** Type in the APR from your loan offer. If you are exploring hypothetical scenarios, try a range of APRs to see how they affect cost.
3. **Select the term.** Choose the repayment period in months. Try multiple terms to see the tradeoff between lower monthly payments and lower total interest.
4. **Review your results.** The calculator instantly displays your monthly payment, total cost, and total interest. No sign-up required, no personal information needed.

The real power of the calculator comes from running multiple scenarios back to back. Change one variable at a time — APR, term, or amount — and watch how the outputs shift. The comparison tables below show you what to expect.

## Comparison Examples

These tables illustrate the three most important comparisons every borrower should run. All figures are calculated using standard amortization.

### Same Amount, Different APRs

This is the most important comparison. It shows how dramatically APR affects the cost of the same loan.

**$1,000 borrowed for 12 months at different APRs:**

| APR | Monthly Payment | Total Repaid | Total Interest |
|-----|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| 15% | $90 | $1,083 | $83 |
| 24% | $94 | $1,134 | $134 |
| 36% | $100 | $1,197 | $197 |
| 200% | $167 | $2,003 | $1,003 |
| 400% | $248 | $2,973 | $1,973 |

<StatHighlight value="24x" label="more interest at 400% APR vs 15% APR on the same $1,000 loan ($1,973 vs $83)" icon="warning" variant="red" />

At 15% APR, borrowing $1,000 costs you $83 in interest. At 400% APR, the same $1,000 costs you $1,973. The monthly payment difference between 15% and 24% is only $4, but the total interest difference is $51. At the extreme end, a 400% APR loan costs almost double the original loan amount in interest alone.

This is why shopping for the lowest available APR is the single most effective way to reduce your borrowing costs. For strategies on finding lower rates, see our guide on [how to compare loan offers](/guides/how-to-compare-loan-offers).

### Same Amount and APR, Different Terms

This comparison shows the tradeoff between monthly payment comfort and total cost.

**$3,000 borrowed at 24% APR for different terms:**

| Term | Monthly Payment | Total Repaid | Total Interest |
|------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| 6 months | $531 | $3,183 | $183 |
| 12 months | $282 | $3,389 | $389 |
| 18 months | $200 | $3,597 | $597 |
| 24 months | $158 | $3,803 | $803 |

The 6-month term costs $183 in interest. The 24-month term costs $803 — more than **four times as much** — for the same amount borrowed at the same APR. The monthly payment drops from $531 to $158, which feels much more manageable. But that comfort costs an extra $620 in interest.

The right choice depends on your budget. If you can afford $282 per month, the 12-month term saves you $414 compared to the 24-month option. Choose the shortest term you can comfortably afford — "comfortably" meaning with room in your budget for unexpected expenses.

### Different Amounts at the Same APR

This comparison helps you determine how much you actually need to borrow. Interest costs scale proportionally with the loan amount.

**Different amounts at 24% APR for 12 months:**

| Loan Amount | Monthly Payment | Total Repaid | Total Interest |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|----------------|
| $500 | $47 | $565 | $65 |
| $1,000 | $94 | $1,134 | $134 |
| $2,000 | $189 | $2,264 | $264 |
| $5,000 | $471 | $5,653 | $653 |

The interest costs are roughly proportional: borrow twice as much, pay roughly twice as much interest. This means every extra dollar you borrow has a real cost. If you need $1,500 but a lender offers $3,000, borrowing the extra $1,500 costs you approximately $200 more in interest at this rate. Only borrow what you need.

## Common Calculator Mistakes

Even with a calculator in front of them, borrowers frequently make these errors.

<Callout type="warning" title="Don't Confuse Interest Rate With APR">
The most common calculator mistake is entering the interest rate instead of the APR. The APR includes mandatory fees the interest rate does not. Always use the APR for accurate results.
</Callout>

### Using Interest Rate Instead of APR

The interest rate and the APR are not the same number. The APR includes mandatory fees (like origination fees) that the interest rate does not. If you enter the interest rate instead of the APR, the calculator will underestimate your actual cost. Always use the APR — it is the number that reflects the full annual cost of borrowing. For a complete breakdown, read our guide on [APR vs interest rate](/guides/apr-vs-interest-rate).

### Forgetting Origination Fees

Some lenders deduct an origination fee from your loan proceeds. If you need $5,000 in cash and the lender charges a 5% origination fee, you need to borrow approximately $5,263 to receive $5,000 after the fee. The calculator shows the cost of the full loan amount, not the net amount you receive.

### Only Looking at Monthly Payment

A $100 monthly payment sounds more affordable than a $200 monthly payment. But if the $100 payment runs for 36 months ($3,600 total) and the $200 payment runs for 12 months ($2,400 total), the "affordable" option costs $1,200 more. Always check the total cost column, not just the monthly payment.

### Not Comparing Multiple Scenarios

Running the calculator once with a single set of inputs tells you very little. The value comes from running 5 to 10 scenarios: different APRs, different terms, different amounts. This is how you find the combination that balances affordability and cost.

## Advanced Uses

Once you are comfortable with basic calculations, a loan calculator can answer more sophisticated questions.

### How Much Extra Payments Save

If your loan allows prepayment without penalty, paying even $25 or $50 extra per month can significantly reduce total interest. Run the calculator with a shorter term that corresponds to your higher payment amount to estimate the savings. For example, if your scheduled payment on a $3,000, 24% APR, 24-month loan is $158, but you can pay $200 per month, run the calculator at the same amount and APR but with an 18-month term. The difference in total interest — $803 vs. $597 in the table above — shows you would save approximately $206 by paying extra.

### Converting a Fee Quote to APR

Payday lenders often quote fees as a dollar amount per $100 borrowed rather than as an APR. To convert: if a lender charges $15 per $100 for a 14-day loan, the fee is 15% for 14 days. Annualized, that is approximately 391% APR ($15 / $100 x 365 / 14 x 100). Entering that APR into the calculator alongside an installment loan offer makes the cost difference immediately visible.

### Comparing a Payday Loan to an Installment Loan

This is one of the most valuable comparisons. Suppose you need $500. A payday lender charges $15 per $100 for 14 days ($75 fee, $575 due in two weeks). An installment lender offers $500 at 36% APR for 6 months. Enter $500 at 36% APR for 6 months into the calculator: you get approximately $86 per month, $516 total, $54 in interest.

<ComparisonRow title="$500 Borrowed: Payday Loan vs Installment Loan" options={[
  { title: "Payday Loan", variant: "red", stats: [{ label: "APR", value: "391%" }, { label: "Total Cost", value: "$75 fee" }, { label: "Due", value: "14 days" }] },
  { title: "Installment Loan", variant: "green", recommended: true, stats: [{ label: "APR", value: "36%" }, { label: "Total Interest", value: "$54" }, { label: "Term", value: "6 months" }] }
]} />

The payday loan costs $75 for two weeks. The installment loan costs $54 over six months — and gives you six months of manageable monthly payments instead of a $575 lump sum due in 14 days. If the payday loan gets rolled over even once, it costs $150 — nearly three times the installment loan's total interest. Use the calculator to see these differences in dollars, not just percentages.

For more on this comparison, see our guide on [payday loans vs. installment loans](/guides/payday-loans-vs-installment-loans).

<Callout type="tip" title="Run Multiple Scenarios">
The real power of a loan calculator comes from comparison. Run at least 5 to 10 scenarios — change one variable at a time (APR, term, or amount) to find the combination that costs the least in total interest while fitting your monthly budget.
</Callout>

## Try It Yourself

The best way to understand your borrowing costs is to run the numbers. Open the FundingZest [loan calculator](/calculator), enter the details from any loan offer you are considering, and see exactly what it will cost.

Then change the inputs. Try a lower amount. Try a shorter term. Try the APR from a competing offer. The scenario that costs the least in total interest — while still fitting your monthly budget — is the one to choose.

When you are ready to see real offers from real lenders, [browse lending options](/borrow) or submit a single application to compare pre-qualified rates.
