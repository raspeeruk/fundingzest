faqs:
  - question: "How many missed payments before a loan goes to default?"
    answer: "For most loans, default occurs after 30-90 days of missed payments. Payday loans may default after a single missed payment (since they're due in 2-4 weeks). Federal student loans default after 270 days. Mortgages typically default after 3-6 missed payments. The exact timeline depends on the lender and loan type."
  - question: "Can I go to jail for not paying a loan?"
    answer: "No. You cannot be jailed for failing to pay a civil debt in the United States. Debtor's prisons were abolished federally in 1833. However, you can face legal consequences including lawsuits, wage garnishment, and bank account levies. If a court orders you to appear and you don't, contempt of court charges are possible."
  - question: "How long does a default stay on my credit report?"
    answer: "A default (and any subsequent collection account) stays on your credit report for 7 years from the date of the first missed payment that led to the default. The negative impact on your score decreases over time, especially after the first 2-3 years."
  - question: "Can defaulting on a payday loan affect my bank account?"
    answer: "Yes. Most payday lenders have authorization to withdraw from your bank account. If you default, they may attempt multiple withdrawals, potentially causing overdraft fees. Some states limit the number of withdrawal attempts. You can revoke ACH authorization, but this doesn't eliminate the debt."
  - question: "What should I do if I can't make a loan payment?"
    answer: "Contact your lender immediately — before the payment is due if possible. Many lenders offer hardship programs, extended payment plans, or modified terms. Ignoring the problem always makes it worse. If you can't resolve it with the lender, contact a nonprofit credit counselor through the NFCC."

Missing a loan payment is stressful. Missing several can feel catastrophic. But understanding what actually happens when a loan goes into default — the specific timeline, the real consequences, and the concrete steps you can take — puts you in a far better position than ignoring the problem and hoping it resolves itself.

Default does not happen overnight. There is almost always a window to act, and the earlier you act, the more options you have. This guide explains the full sequence of events, the consequences by loan type, your legal rights, and exactly what to do if you're falling behind.

## What Does "Default" Mean?

Default and delinquency are related but not the same thing.

**Delinquency** means you are late on a payment. The moment you miss a due date, your account becomes delinquent. A single late payment is a delinquency. Delinquency is a status — it describes the current state of your account.

**Default** means you have breached the terms of your loan agreement, typically by missing multiple payments over a sustained period. Default is a formal action — the lender declares the loan in default, which triggers a specific set of consequences.

Think of it this way: delinquency is being late on your homework. Default is being expelled. The first is a warning; the second changes your situation fundamentally.

The timeline from delinquency to default varies by loan type:

- **Payday loans:** Can default after a single missed payment (since the term is only 2-4 weeks)
- **Installment loans and personal loans:** Typically default after 30-90 days of missed payments
- **Credit cards:** Usually charge off after 180 days (6 months) of non-payment
- **Auto loans:** May default after 1-3 missed payments (repossession can begin quickly)
- **Mortgages:** Typically default after 3-6 missed payments (90-180 days)
- **Federal student loans:** Default after 270 days (9 months) of non-payment

## The Timeline of a Loan Default

While the exact timeline varies by lender and loan type, most defaults follow a predictable pattern. Understanding this pattern helps you recognize where you are and what's coming next.

### Days 1-29: Grace Period and Late Fees

You've missed your payment due date. Most lenders offer a short grace period (typically 10-15 days) before imposing penalties. After the grace period, expect a **late fee** — usually $25-$50 or a percentage of the missed payment (often 3-6%).

During this window, your account is delinquent but the missed payment has **not yet been reported to credit bureaus**. If you can make the payment within 29 days of the due date, you will owe the late fee but your credit report remains unaffected.

**This is the cheapest and easiest time to resolve the problem.** A single phone call and a payment can end it here.

### Day 30: Credit Bureau Reporting Begins

At 30 days past due, most lenders report the delinquency to one or more of the three major credit bureaus — Equifax, Experian, and TransUnion. A "30 days late" mark appears on your credit report.

**This is a turning point.** A single 30-day late payment can drop your credit score by 60 to 110 points, depending on your starting score. Borrowers with higher scores experience larger drops. This mark stays on your credit report for 7 years.

Additional late fees may be charged. The lender will likely contact you by phone, email, or letter to request payment.

### Days 60-90: Escalation

If payments remain missed, the lender reports 60-day and then 90-day delinquencies. Each additional reporting period further damages your score. Collection calls and letters intensify. At this stage, many lenders transfer your account to their **internal collections department**.

Your loan may also trigger a **default interest rate** — some loan agreements include a clause that raises your interest rate when you become delinquent, increasing the total amount owed.

### Days 90-180: Charge-Off and External Collections

After approximately 90 to 180 days (varies by loan type), the lender may **charge off** your account. A charge-off does not mean you no longer owe the money. It is an accounting action — the lender writes off the debt as a loss on their books.

After charge-off, the lender typically either:

1. **Sells the debt** to a third-party collection agency for pennies on the dollar (often 4-20 cents per dollar of debt), or
2. **Assigns the debt** to a collection agency that works on commission to recover the amount

A new "collection account" may now appear on your credit report alongside the original charge-off — further damaging your score.

### After Charge-Off: Legal Action

If collection efforts fail, the collection agency or original lender may file a **lawsuit** against you. If they win (or you don't respond to the lawsuit and a **default judgment** is entered), they can pursue:

- **Wage garnishment:** A court order requiring your employer to withhold a portion of your pay and send it to the creditor
- **Bank account levy:** A court order allowing the creditor to seize funds from your bank account
- **Property liens:** A legal claim against your property (usually real estate) that must be satisfied when the property is sold

Not every defaulted loan results in a lawsuit — the amount owed, the creditor's policies, and the cost of litigation all factor into that decision. But it is a real possibility, especially for larger debts.

## Consequences by Loan Type

The specific consequences of default depend on what type of loan you have.

| Loan Type | Default Timeline | Primary Consequences | Collateral at Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| Payday loan | 1 missed payment (2-4 weeks) | Repeated ACH withdrawal attempts, bank overdraft fees, collection calls, possible lawsuit | None (unsecured), but bank account is at risk of overdraft |
| Installment loan | 30-90 days | Credit damage, late fees, collections, possible lawsuit | None (typically unsecured) |
| Title loan | 30 days or 1 missed payment | **Vehicle repossession** — lender can seize your car, often without court order | Your vehicle |
| Auto loan | 1-3 missed payments | **Vehicle repossession**, credit damage, deficiency balance if car sells for less than owed | Your vehicle |
| Credit card | 180 days | Charge-off, collections, lawsuit, wage garnishment | None (unsecured) |
| Federal student loan | 270 days | Wage garnishment (no court order needed), tax refund seizure, Social Security offset, loss of federal aid eligibility | None, but government has special collection powers |
| Mortgage | 3-6 missed payments | **Foreclosure** — loss of home, severe credit damage lasting 7+ years | Your home |

### Payday Loan Default: Special Considerations

Payday loan defaults deserve specific attention because the mechanics differ from other loan types. When you take out a payday loan, you typically authorize the lender to withdraw repayment directly from your bank account via ACH. If you default:

- The lender may attempt **multiple ACH withdrawals**, each of which can trigger a $25-$35 overdraft fee from your bank
- Some states limit the number of withdrawal attempts lenders can make
- The debt may be sent to collections, and collectors can be aggressive
- Some payday lenders file lawsuits in small claims court

**You have the right to revoke ACH authorization.** Contact your bank in writing to stop the payday lender's automatic withdrawals. However, revoking ACH authorization does not eliminate the debt — you still owe the money, and the lender can pursue other collection methods.

## Impact on Your Credit Score

The credit damage from default is significant and long-lasting. Here is what to expect at each stage:

| Event | Approximate Score Impact | How Long It Stays on Your Report |
|---|---|---|
| 30-day late payment | -60 to -110 points | 7 years |
| 60-day late payment | -70 to -120 points (cumulative) | 7 years |
| 90-day late payment | -80 to -130 points (cumulative) | 7 years |
| Charge-off | Additional -50 to -100 points | 7 years from first missed payment |
| Collection account | Additional -50 to -100 points | 7 years from first missed payment |
| Repossession | -100 to -150+ points | 7 years |
| Foreclosure | -100 to -160+ points | 7 years |
| Bankruptcy | -130 to -240 points | 7-10 years |

These impacts are approximate — the actual effect depends on your starting score, overall credit profile, and the scoring model used. Borrowers with higher starting scores experience larger point drops.

The good news: the damage fades over time. The most severe impact occurs in the first 12-24 months. After 2-3 years, the negative items still appear on your report but have progressively less influence on your score. By year 5-6, many borrowers who have otherwise maintained good credit habits see significant score recovery.

## Collections: What to Expect

If your debt is sent to a collection agency, understanding your rights is essential. The [Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA)](https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/statutes/fair-debt-collection-practices-act) is a federal law that governs how collectors can interact with you.

### What Collectors CAN Do

- Contact you by phone, mail, email, or text during reasonable hours (8 AM - 9 PM in your time zone)
- Contact your employer to verify employment or location (but not to discuss the debt)
- Report the debt to credit bureaus
- File a lawsuit to recover the debt
- Negotiate settlements for less than the full amount owed

### What Collectors CANNOT Do

- Threaten you with arrest or jail
- Use obscene, profane, or abusive language
- Call repeatedly with intent to harass
- Contact you before 8 AM or after 9 PM
- Discuss your debt with friends, family, neighbors, or coworkers (except your spouse or attorney)
- Misrepresent the amount you owe
- Threaten legal action they don't intend to take
- Contact you at all if you send a written request to stop (though the debt still exists)

### Your Right to Debt Validation

Within 30 days of first contact, you have the right to request a **debt validation letter.** This forces the collector to prove that the debt is legitimate and that they have the legal right to collect it. Send your request in writing (certified mail is recommended). The collector must stop collection activity until they provide validation.

This is especially important if you don't recognize the debt, if the amount seems wrong, or if the debt may be past the statute of limitations in your state. Debts that are too old to be legally enforced may still be collected on — but they cannot be the basis for a lawsuit.

For comprehensive guidance on your rights during collection, visit the [Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's debt collection resources](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/consumer-tools/debt-collection/).

## Legal Consequences

Default can lead to legal action. Here is what that looks like in practice:

### Lawsuits

A creditor or collection agency can file a civil lawsuit to recover the debt. If you are sued, you will receive a court summons. **Do not ignore it.** If you fail to respond, the court will likely enter a **default judgment** against you — meaning the creditor wins automatically without you presenting your side.

With a judgment, the creditor gains access to enforcement tools:

### Wage Garnishment

A court can order your employer to withhold a portion of your paycheck and send it directly to the creditor. Federal law limits garnishment to the lesser of:

- **25% of your disposable earnings** (after taxes and mandatory deductions), or
- The amount by which your weekly earnings exceed 30 times the federal minimum wage

Some states have lower garnishment limits. Certain income types are **exempt** from garnishment, including Social Security benefits, Supplemental Security Income (SSI), disability benefits, and veterans' benefits.

### Bank Account Levy

A creditor with a court judgment can obtain a levy on your bank account, allowing them to seize funds directly. Some deposits are protected — Social Security and other federal benefits deposited in the last 2 months are generally exempt.

### What CANNOT Happen

**You cannot go to jail for failing to pay a civil debt.** Federal law and the laws of every state prohibit debtor's imprisonment. However, if a court orders you to appear for a debtor's examination (a hearing about your assets and income) and you fail to appear, you could face contempt of court charges — which carry their own penalties. Always respond to court orders.

## What to Do If You're Falling Behind

This is the most important section of this guide. If you're struggling to make loan payments, taking action early gives you the most options and the least damage. Waiting until the account is in collections drastically limits your choices.

### 1. Contact Your Lender Immediately

Call your lender **before** you miss a payment if possible, or as soon as possible after. Explain your situation honestly. Lenders would rather work with you than send your account to collections — collection is expensive and they recover less.

Ask specifically about:

- **Hardship programs:** Many lenders offer temporary reduced payments, interest rate reductions, or payment pauses (forbearance) for borrowers experiencing financial hardship
- **Extended payment plans:** Particularly for payday loans — many states require lenders to offer an extended payment plan at no additional cost if you request one before the due date
- **Modified repayment terms:** Extending your loan term reduces monthly payments (though total interest paid increases)
- **Deferment or forbearance:** Temporarily pausing payments while you recover financially

### 2. Know Your State's Protections

Many states have borrower protection laws, particularly for payday and small-dollar loans. Some states require lenders to offer extended payment plans, limit the number of ACH withdrawal attempts, cap late fees, or mandate cooling-off periods. Contact your [state attorney general's office](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/) or state financial regulator to understand your rights.

### 3. Contact a Nonprofit Credit Counselor

The [National Foundation for Credit Counseling (NFCC)](https://www.nfcc.org/) connects you with certified credit counselors who can help you create a budget, negotiate with creditors, and develop a debt management plan. Sessions are free or low-cost. Avoid for-profit debt relief companies that charge upfront fees — many deliver poor results or make your situation worse.

### 4. Prioritize Your Debts

If you cannot pay everything, prioritize strategically:

- **Secured debts first** (mortgage, auto loan) — default means losing your home or vehicle
- **Debts with the worst default consequences** (student loans with wage garnishment risk)
- **Debts closest to reporting** (if you're within 29 days late, paying now prevents credit damage)

### 5. Understand What You Can Negotiate

Even after default, negotiation is possible:

- **Lump-sum settlement:** Collectors often accept 25-60% of the original balance if you can pay in a single payment
- **Pay-for-delete:** Some collectors will remove the collection from your credit report in exchange for full payment (get this in writing before paying)
- **Payment plan:** Spreading the settlement over several months

## How to Recover After Default

Default is damaging but not permanent. Recovery is possible with consistent effort.

**Pay off or settle the debt.** Whether you pay in full or negotiate a settlement, resolving the underlying debt stops further collection activity and demonstrates responsibility to future lenders.

**Rebuild your credit.** After resolving defaulted debts, begin adding positive information to your credit report. A [credit-builder loan](/guides/credit-builder-loans) is designed exactly for this purpose. Secured credit cards are another effective option. For more strategies, see our guide on [how to improve your credit score](/guides/how-to-improve-credit-score).

**Monitor your credit report.** Request free reports at [AnnualCreditReport.com](https://www.annualcreditreport.com) and verify that resolved debts are accurately reported. Dispute any errors with the credit bureau directly.

**Create a budget that prevents future defaults.** A default is often a symptom of a budget that doesn't account for all obligations. Build an emergency fund — even $500 provides a buffer against the unexpected expenses that trigger missed payments.

## Alternatives to Default

If you're heading toward default but haven't arrived yet, these options may help you avoid it entirely:

- **Refinancing:** Replace your current loan with one that has lower payments. Compare [installment loan](/loans/installment) options to see if you can reduce your monthly obligation.
- **Debt consolidation:** Combine multiple debts into a single loan with one payment. This can lower your total monthly payments and simplify management.
- **Balance transfer:** Move high-interest credit card debt to a card with a 0% introductory APR (requires qualifying credit).
- **Negotiate directly with creditors:** Many will modify terms before default occurs — they just need you to ask.
- **Seek community assistance:** For debts driven by inability to cover basic expenses, local community organizations, 211 helpline, and government programs may be able to help. See our guide on [payday loan alternatives](/guides/payday-loan-alternatives) for specific resources.

## Key Takeaways

- Default is the formal breach of your loan agreement, triggered after sustained non-payment — not a single missed payment (except for payday loans, which can default after one missed payment)
- The first 29 days after a missed payment are your best window to act — pay before day 30 to avoid credit bureau reporting
- A 30-day late payment can drop your credit score by 60-110 points; charge-offs, collections, and judgments cause further damage
- Consequences vary by loan type: unsecured loans lead to collections and lawsuits, while secured loans (auto, mortgage, title) can result in repossession or foreclosure
- You cannot be jailed for failing to pay a civil debt, but you can face wage garnishment, bank levies, and property liens through court action
- Contact your lender immediately if you're struggling — hardship programs, extended payment plans, and modified terms are often available but only if you ask
- The Fair Debt Collection Practices Act protects you from abusive collection tactics — know your rights and use them
- Recovery after default is possible: settle or pay the debt, rebuild credit with credit-builder products, and create a budget that prevents recurrence
